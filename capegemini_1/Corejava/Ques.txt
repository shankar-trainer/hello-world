Write a class Account with attribute 
   float  balance
   String accountHolderName;
   String location;
   
Also write three methods with the following signature –

void deposit(int amt)
void withdraw(int amt)
float getBalance()
void accountInfo()

withdraw method should give a message insufficient amount if the
amount you are trying to withdraw is more than current balance
otherwise balance need to be reduced by the amount withdrawn

Create another class TestAccount and write down main method there.
Create an object of Account class. 
Start the account with Rs 2000.
Add Rs 500 and withdraw Rs 1800. Then show the balance.
Add Rs 700 and withdraw Rs 4000. Then show the balance.



Question

Use  appropriate Constructor, getter and setter    
   
Test it with DistanceMain 

Question   
Create class Insurance with attributes 
  private String health;  // excellent or poor
  private int age;
  private String gender;  // male or female
  private String location; // city or village

	the sex is female then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand
	and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh.
(3) If a person’s health is poor and the person is between 25
	and 35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male
	then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy
	cannot exceed Rs. 10,000.
(4) In all other cases the person is not insured.
	whether the person should be insured or not, his/her premium rate and maximum amount
	for which he/she can be insured.

  } 

  In bookInfo() display the actual cost and final cost
  
    var arguments 
      --> Added in java5
      --> It can accept variable number of arguments
      --> It should the last argument.
      --> In one method we can have one var arguments.
      --> It supports for each loop.
      --> denoted by ...
