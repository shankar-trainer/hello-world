Question Interface

You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature int divisor_sum(int n). 
You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the interface.

divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors.

 For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12. The value of n will be at most 1000.
Read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. 

You just need to write the MyCalculator class only. Your class shouldn't be public.

Sample Input
6

Sample Output
I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12

Explanation
Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6. 1+2+3+6=12.

String Question

Question 
 Take a String from user and check whether 
    it is palindrome.
For this make one static boolean 
   checkPalindrome(String s) method.
 
Question 
 Take a multi words String from user and display
 the count of vowel and space.  
    For this make method 
    int [] countVowelSpace(String s)
  
    ball    -----------> player1 --------->player2
	
	
Exception Question
	
	
Java has built-in mechanism to handle exceptions. Using the try statement we can test a block of code for errors. The catch block contains the code that says what to do if exception occurs. 

This problem will test your knowledge on try-catch block.
You will be given two integers and as input, you have to compute .

If and are not bit signed integers or if is zero, exception will occur and you have to report it. 
Read sample Input/Output to know what to report in case of exceptions.

Sample Input :
10
3
Sample Output :
3

Sample Input :
10
Hello
Sample Output :
java.util.InputMismatchException

Sample Input :
10
0
Sample Output :
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

Sample Input :
23.323
0
Sample Output :
java.util.InputMismatchException

Exception Question 2
	You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator. 
	Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int). 
	
	This method takes two integers n, and p, as parameters and finds . 

	If either n or  p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n or p should not be negative".
	
	Also, if both n and p are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should not be zero."
	
For example, -4 and -5 would result in 
java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.

Complete the function power in class MyCalculator and return the appropriate result after the power operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above. 

Sample Input: 
3 5
2 4
0 0
-1 -2
-1 3
Sample Output: 
243
16
java.lang.Exception: n and p should not be zero.
java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.
java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.

    	Exception Question 3

Write a program to get the name and age of the player from the user and  display it. 

player name is a string 
player age is an integer value 

Note : The player is eligible to participate in IPL when their age is 19 and above 
  This program may generate   
1. InvalidAgeRange Custom Exception when the player's age is below 19 
 Use exception handling mechanisms to handle these exceptions 

 Create a class called CustomException which extends Exception and it includes constructor to initialize the message. 
 
 Use appropriate exception handling mechanisms to handle these exceptions  
Sample  Input/Output 1:
	Enter the player name
	Albie Morkel
	Enter the player age
	35
	Player name : Albie Morkel
	Player age : 35
 
Sample  Input/Output 2:
	Enter the player name
	Ishan Kishan
	Enter the player age
	16
	CustomException: InvalidAgeRangeException	
	
	
Thread Question
Question1.
Write a program to assign the current thread to t1. Change the name of the thread to MyThread.
Display the changed name of the thread. 

Also it should display the current time. 
Put the thread to sleep for 10 seconds and display the time again.
