Create a class Circle having attributes radius and method area and circumference.

Create object of circle add radius value and then call area and circumference.


Create class Student having attributes 


   roll 
   name
   subject1
   subject2
   marks1
   marks2
   
Using constructor initialize all instance variable

   make one method studentInfo()
      it display all values along with total and average marks
       display the grade as given the range 
       
       average  
           75 -- 100 -- distinction
           60 -- 74 -- first
           50 -- 59 -- second
           35 -- 49 -- third
           0 -- 34     fail 
           
           
               
Book.java 

    float discount;
    String type ;
    
       type        discount 
       computer     40%
       literature   50%
       kids         30%
       law          20 
       
           

   this --- 
       this.instance variable 
       
       this.prdId = prdId;
		this.prdName = prdName;
		this.prdCost = prdCost;
		
		--- this is making difference between local variable and instance variable
		
      this(argument)       -- calling another constructor
