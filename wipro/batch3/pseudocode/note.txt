logical operator trith table 


OR 
  -- any condition is true then result will be true 

     OR TRUTH TABLE

    condition1 condition2   result 
      T		T		T
      F		T		T
      T		F		T
      F		F		F


  AND 
       if any of the condition is false result is  false
       all conditions are true then the result is true 

     OR TRUTH TABLE

    condition1 condition2   result 
      T		T		T
      F		T		F
      F		F		F
      T		F		F

Iteration
    It is repetitive statement and will execute till condition 
    is true 

    its implemented using three loop constructs.
    1. while
    2. do while 
    3. for loop 

   1. while loop 
       -- top tested loop 
       -- it requires one counter or condition check variable 
       
       counter/condition check variable 
          while  condition
             body
          end while   

factorial 
     5 --  1*2*3*4*5
            5*4*3*2*1 

     0 -- 1

DO WHILE  LOOP 
    -- BOTTOM TESTED 
    -- EXECUTE AT LEAST ONCE
