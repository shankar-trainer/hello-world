 Overriding 
     -- no weaker access modifier
     -- same or hihger access modifier

Cannot reduce the visibility of the 
inherited method from Computer  

this and super 
   this -- current class reference
   super -- parent class reference
   
   
   static method is not overridden
   but it can be re written 
   
   
   inside static this and super can not be used
   
   constructor is not inherited.
   it is called by the super() keyword    


  Reference Casting 
  
    -- allows casting in inheritance hierarchy.
    
    abstract class 
    
         super class with abstract method
         abstract method has only declaration no body
         
         it gives abstraction feature
         
         abstraction -- class should have essential methods(abstract methods)
         
         abstract class cannot be instantiated.
         
         abstract class can be sub classed.
         
         abstract class can have constructor, abstract methods and non abstract
         
         
    interface 
             -- 100% abstract class 
             -- it has only abstract methods, no concrete methods 
             -- all methods are by default public abstract
             -- multiple inheritance 
             
             -- one interface can extends multiple interfaces
             -- one class  can extends only one class but it can implements multiple interfaces
             
             -- can have only class variable 
             -- by default all variables are public static and final
             
          in sub class abstract class is used by extends key word
          in sub class interface is used by implements keyword
