Assuming your timestamp field is named ts, you can do something like this:

SELECT COUNT(*), DAY(ts), MONTH(ts), YEAR(ts) FROM tableName
       GROUP BY YEAR(ts), MONTH(ts), DAY(ts);
How to generate daily reports for individual people
Ok this is what you really wanted. Let's draw a sample table with some records:

ts                      person         sales
2011-12-01 10:00:00     John           10
2011-12-01 10:30:00     Mary           25
2011-12-01 11:00:00     John           20
2011-12-02 14:00:00     John           40
To get the daily totals for a particular person, you would do:

SELECT SUM(sales), DAY(ts), MONTH(ts), YEAR(ts) FROM tableName
       WHERE person='John'
       GROUP BY YEAR(ts), MONTH(ts), DAY(ts);
This is selecting records where person is John, grouped by unique days, and summing the sales value for those records. If you want reports for every person combined, just remove the WHERE clause.
