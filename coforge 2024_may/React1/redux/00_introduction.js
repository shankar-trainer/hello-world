// Tutorial 0 - introduction.js

// Why this tutorial?
// While trying to learn Redux, I realized that I had accumulated incorrect knowledge about flux through
// articles I read and personal experience. I don't mean that articles about flux are not well written
// but I just didn't grasp concepts correctly. In the end, I was just applying documentation of different
// flux frameworks (Reflux, Flummox, FB Flux) and trying to make them match with the theoretical concept I read
// about (actions / actions creators, store, dispatcher, etc).
// Only when I started using Redux did I realize that flux is more simple than I thought. This is all
// thanks to Redux being very well designed and having removed a lot of "anti-boilerplate features" introduced
// by other frameworks I tried before. I now feel that Redux is a much better way to learn about flux
// than many other frameworks. That's why I want now to share with everyone, using my own words,
// flux concepts that I am starting to grasp, focusing on the use of Redux.

// You may have seen this diagram representing the famous unidirectional data flow of a flux application:

// In this tutorial we'll gradually introduce you to concepts of the diagram above. But instead of trying
// to explain this complete diagram and the overall flow it describes, we'll take each piece separately and try to
// understand why it exists and what role it plays. In the end you'll see that this diagram makes perfect sense
// once we understand each of its parts.

// But before we start, let's talk a little bit about why flux exists and why we need it...
// Let's pretend we're building a web application. What are all web applications made of?
// 1) Templates / html = View
// 2) Data that will populate our views = Models
// 3) Logic to retrieve data, glue all views together and to react accordingly to user events,
//    data modifications, etc. = Controller

// This is the very classic MVC that we all know about. But it actually looks like concepts of flux,
// just expressed in a slightly different way:
// - Models look like stores
// - user events, data modifications and their handlers look like
//   "action creators" -> action -> dispatcher -> callback
// - Views look like React views (or anything else as far as flux is concerned)

// So is flux just a matter of new vocabulary? Not exactly. But vocabulary DOES matter, because by introducing
// these new terms we are now able to express more precisely things that were regrouped under
// various terminologies... For example, isn't a data fetch an action? Just like a click is also an action?
// And a change in an input is an action too... Then we're all already used to issuing actions from our
// applications, we were just calling them differently. And instead of having handlers for those
// actions directly modify Models or Views, flux ensures all actions go first through something called
// a dispatcher, then through our stores, and finally all watchers of stores are notified.

// To get more clarity how MVC and flux differ, we'll
// take a classic use-case in an MVC application:
// In a classic MVC application you could easily end up with:
// 1) User clicks on button "A"
// 2) A click handler on button "A" triggers a change on Model "A"
// 3) A change handler on Model "A" triggers a change on Model "B"
// 4) A change handler on Model "B" triggers a change on View "B" that re-renders itself

// Finding the source of a bug in such an environment when something goes wrong can become quite challenging
// very quickly. This is because every View can watch every Model, and every Model can watch other Models, so
// basically data can arrive from a lot of places and be changed by a lot of sources (any views or any models).

// Whereas when using flux and its unidirectional data flow, the example above could become:
// 1) user clicks on button "A"
// 2) a handler on button "A" triggers an action that is dispatched and produces a change on Store "A"
// 3) since all other stores are also notified about the action, Store B can react to the same action too
// 4) View "B" gets notified by the change in Stores A and B, and re-renders

// See how we avoid directly linking Store A to Store B? Each store can only be
// modified by an action and nothing else. And once all stores have replied to an action,
// views can finally update. So in the end, data always flows in one way:
//     action -> store -> view -> action -> store -> view -> action -> ...

// Just as we started our use case above from an action, let's start our tutorial with
// actions and action creators.
