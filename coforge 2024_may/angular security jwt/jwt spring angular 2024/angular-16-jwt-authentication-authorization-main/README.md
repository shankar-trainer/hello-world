## Backend API
For this Angular application to function correctly, you need a backend API that handles authentication and provides the necessary data.
You can find the source code for the backend API on the corresponding GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MossaabFrifita/spring-boot-3-security-6-jwt).
Make sure you also have the backend API up and running to fully test the authentication and authorization features of this Angular application.
