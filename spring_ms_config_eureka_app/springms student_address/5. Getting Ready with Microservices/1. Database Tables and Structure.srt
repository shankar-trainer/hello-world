Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,880
Let's have a look at the database structure that we are going to use in the upcoming lecture's.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:18,110
So here we have one schema that is university, and inside that we have two tables, address and student.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,460
So this is our address table and here we are having three columns.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,570
This is basically the primary Geof address table and auto increment by my secretaries and other two

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:29,990
columns.

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,660
We have street and city now.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,150
And another table we have is student table.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,620
And here we have a couple of columns like Student ID.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,220
So this is primarily an auto increment by MySQL database.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,210
We have a first name column, last name, email and address ID.

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,470
So this is basically Fortensky and this is primary of our address table.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,620
So here student is having addressed and that is the relationship between our student and address table

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,100
as of now, what the tables are having two rows in the address table.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
We have two rows and in student table as well, we have two rows.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,240
So we have two students.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,860
And it's details in our database and the schema is university.

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,180
So this is our MySQL database that we are going to use in the upcoming lectures.

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,270
So that's all for now.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,910
Will proceed further in the next lecture.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,050
Thank you very much.
