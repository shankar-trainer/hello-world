00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,990
So now we are all set with Sloup and Zipkin, so let's test it out.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,860
So here all things are running Unica, Savar, a big gateway, and our micro services that are student

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,120
and address services.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,530
And Zipkin is running on the bottom line for in our local mussen.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,630
OK, so let's do Posman.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,520
Let's say this Garibay.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,260
So now we got the response.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,050
Let's go to Browsr and here just click on this run query.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,280
See, we got this one request.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,410
OK, so if you click on this run query, it will list down all the request.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,830
So just click on the saw.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,890
See, this is the complete flaw for this particular request that we just now hit.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,230
So the request was coming to get away from there, it's going to in service, and we know that from

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,910
room service, we are calling it a service, but that call is not direct.

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,180
We are using the EPA gateway to call the address service from a student service so that also you can

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,590
see or hear from students service to EPA Gateway and from Gateway.

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,240
It's going to address service.

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,870
You see, this is the sponsored and this is the matter.

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,280
This is the air traffic controller, the Mitani.

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,260
Same for one student service.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,590
This is the you are right and you see the student controller method and all the things are to get better.

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,870
So this is the complete flaw for this particular request.

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,400
Now let's go back and here you see this plus button.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,180
Just click on it.

26
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,610
Select the service name.

27
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,660
Now it is doing all the applications, see, address, service, get the instrument service.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,270
Why?

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,560
Because for these three springboard applications, the editor sleuth Zipkin dependancy, and also we

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,830
provided the Sipkin Sawat, you are ill.

31
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,620
So now click on the Gateway and you can query Orien.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,600
You get the same result.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,670
OK, now let's turn down the request by Tracery.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,590
So let's jump to ideas and copy this.

35
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,810
You can pick destress from any of the logs because we know.

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,770
Right pressingly same across all the micro services along with the API Gateway.

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,480
Now just put this president here.

38
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,520
Don't click on the enter.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,630
There you go.

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,540
See the same request.

41
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,420
Now we can see.

42
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,290
So whenever you have the tragedy in hand, right, and you want to turn down the request, just go to

43
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:46,160
the Zipkin settlement, put the Presidio here and he the enter it will show you the complete floor for

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,540
this particular request.

45
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,500
So this is how you can trust the request using Sloup and Zipkin, so that's all for now.

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,210
We'll see you in the next lecture.

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,740
Thank you very much.
