Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,390
In this lecture, we will configure slewed.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:14,730
Now, in our case, we have logs in our micro services and also we have logs in API Gateway application,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,650
but we don't have any logs in Eureka server.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,830
So basically we want to trace our request in our micro services as well as in API Gateway.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,530
So we need to add the dependency in our micro services along with API Gateway application.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,630
So that's what we are going to do in this lecture.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,280
So here is the slewed dependency that is sprinklered starter sleuth.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,860
So we need to add this dependency in our address service.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,840
Also, we need to add this dependency on our student service as well as in our API Gateway application.

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:58,620
So make sure you are adding dependency in all your micro services along with the API Gateway application.

12
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:04,400
We don't need to add this in our Eureka server now for our micro services.

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,340
We don't need to do anything apart from adding the dependency, but for our API gateway, we just need

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,930
to do one configuration in our application properties file.

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,010
So let's turn to the application properties for our gateway.

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:29,850
And here we need to set one property for slewed and that is spring dot, slewed dot reactor instrumentation

17
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,240
type.

18
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,320
And here we need to satyrs decorate on each.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,220
That's it.

20
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,600
So this is just required for our API Gateway application only.

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,590
We don't need to add this dependency for our micro services.

22
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,710
So make sure apart from adding the dependencies, you are adding this property in your application.

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,370
DOT properties file for API Gateway application and this is just required for our API Gateway application.

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,330
We don't need to add this dependency for micro services.

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,380
So these are the things we need to do to configure slewed now just for testing purpose.

26
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,150
I waited one long statement inside this metal of student service class.

27
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,010
It's just a simple statement that it is inside the students get by ID.

28
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,310
This is simple long statement.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,870
I read it for testing purposes only.

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,680
So now we are ready with the slewed.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,150
We have done the configuration.

32
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,880
So in the next lecture we will test it out.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,450
Slewed.

34
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,480
So that's all for now.

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,220
We'll see you in the next lecture.

36
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,720
Thank you very much.
