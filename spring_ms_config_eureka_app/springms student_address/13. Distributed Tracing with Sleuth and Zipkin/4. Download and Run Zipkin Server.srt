00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,260
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:11,260
In this lecture, we will download and install Zipkin server local Muzzin and also we will configure

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:18,390
our Micro Services and API Gateway so that we can use Zipkin to download the Zipkin server.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,340
Just go to Google and search for download Zipkin server.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,490
Open this one, QuickStart, this is the official website of Zipkin, that is Zipkin that will come

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,050
down and here you will see the letters released.

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,990
So this is basically jar file.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,390
So download the latest version and we need to run that jar file using the dollar document.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,930
OK, so I'm already having the latest version.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,010
Let me go over there now.

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,610
Open the common room and run the javal, so this will start the Zipkin server in our local Muzzin and

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,340
that will get started on point nine for double one.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,740
See, Zipkin Saval started on nine four, double one taught in our local machine, let's go to Browsr

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,620
and local host.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,990
Nine four one one hit this.

16
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:21,020
So this is the user interface provided by Zipkin, and here we can provide electricity to trace down

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,780
the request, but this part will come in the next lecture.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,370
For now, we need to configure our micro services and API Gateway with Sipkin so that they can pass

19
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,170
the service name to this idea in Spanish to the server.

20
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,090
So lets them do this.

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,760
So the first thing we need to do is we need to add this dependency that is sprinklered, sleuthed Zipkin.

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,850
So we need to add this dependency in our student service also in our address service.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,330
And in our gateway, so make sure you are adding this dependancy to your micro services and a gateway

24
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,760
as well.

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,260
Now, the next thing we need to do is we need to provide the Zipkin server.

26
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:11,510
You are a micro services and API application so that they can pass the service name Tayside sponsored

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,250
to Zipkin server software that lets them do applications or properties.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,790
So this is the student service and here we need to sell the property as spring dot.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,390
Zipkin and besuited, so that is.

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,530
Localhost nine four, double one, so this is the default, you are Zipkin Zabar, you can take it out

31
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,000
of here, OK, this is the default one and still we are providing over here.

32
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,570
Why?

33
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,390
Because in future, if you want to run the Zipkin server on different board, for example, nine five,

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,890
double one, then you will know that this is the property you need to set.

35
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,610
Now, let me copy this and let's jump to.

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,000
All right, reservists and saying we need to provide EPA gateway application, so that's all we need

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,610
to do to configure Zipkin, our micro services and EPA Gateway.

38
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:17,130
So using this URL and using this dependency, Sloup and Zipkin will work together and whatever to decide

39
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,360
and sponsored slewed will generate it will pass that Zipkin server.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,490
We don't need to worry about it and Zipkin will work together internally and Slewed will pass the application

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,940
named President Spinetta to Sipkin Server that is running in our local machine on board ninefold double

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,520
one and the other will be provided for here.

43
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,670
So let's recap the things.

44
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,360
What we did so far in this lecture we downloaded.

45
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,590
Does it concern that is basically executable javal within that javal so Zipkin started on the Port nine

46
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,350
11.

47
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,340
So this is a Zipkin server and in the next lecture we will see this part.

48
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,690
We added the dependencies Zipkin in our Micro Services and API Gateway and also we provided that you

49
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,740
are a lot Zipkin server, Kovar Micro Services and Epper Gateway.

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,780
So these are the things we need to do to configure Zipkin in our micro services and API Gateway.

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,890
Now we are all set with Zipkin so that we will test it out in the next lecture.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,980
So that's all for now.

53
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,770
We'll see you in the next lecture.

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
Thank you very much.
