00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,380
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,290
Now we are all set with Slewed, so let's test it out.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:15,580
So first we will start the Eureka server, then we will start the API gateway after that, what Migros

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,210
Services student and address.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,420
So Disservices API Gateway will take some time.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,290
Let me maximize the console, because here we are going to see the president sponsored for our Advanced

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,730
Micro Services.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,450
Give these services some time to up and configure the EPA gateway, this is started a retro service.

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,230
Let me clear the logs now in the EPA gateway.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,510
Let me clear the logs and for our student service as well.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:57,500
Let me clear the logs now give this service is a minute to configure because we know, right sometimes

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,290
with a gateway, we are getting four or four.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,920
So let's jump to Postman and wait for a minute or hear.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,080
Now, let's hit this to get this, somebody just click on the same.

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,000
We got the response, but we are interested into the logs, so first we will start from the EPA gateway,

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,090
so let them do be a gateway.

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,350
See, these are the logs you see.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,440
And if you go outside, this is for pre filter and post filter.

19
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,650
But here we are interested in this one.

20
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,310
This is the service name.

21
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,360
Whatever we have given in the application, that is fine.

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,970
This is the tree side and this is the spotted.

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,830
So see this idea, this ArsÃ¨ne and same for this one, is it?

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,870
But we are interested into this one.

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,230
So let me copy this.

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,630
This is theme, and that is obvious right now.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,050
Let's jump to student service, search for it.

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,610
So we got it.

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,680
So we have to log statements.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,130
The first is inside the student body and then we are calling the address that is using the faint line

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,050
that we have inside the Common Service.

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,290
Right.

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,540
We have already seen.

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,000
So this is C C that it is same as we have in our gateway.

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,710
But Sponer, it is different.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,240
But these two logs are having the same sponte.

37
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,940
So if we look at within the micro surveys, then two logs are belong to one request only where this

38
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,980
is the spidy.

39
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,650
So this is how you can trust within the micro service.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,380
Now let's turn to address Microscopist such for Braeside.

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,040
Yeah.

42
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,610
There you go.

43
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,810
This is the Treasury, this is the sponte, and we just have one long statement in a dress service,

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,770
but see, the Treasury is saying this is the application name, whatever be given in the application

45
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,150
that properties and this is those PINETTI.

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,280
Now, if we have any other long statement within the same request, obviously it will have the same

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,150
span idee.

48
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,710
Now, we started off with that idea.

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,810
So basically we traced that request across all the micro services and epigraphy because that this idea

50
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,680
will remain missing.

51
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:24,220
And if you want to trace down the request within the micro service, go with this PINETTI like this

52
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,190
this log statements, whatever you have, OK?

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,090
It doesn't matter.

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:36,100
100, 200 search with sponte and all belongs to one request only so you can easily trace down the request

55
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,690
within the service.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
Same applies for what?

57
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,140
API Gateway application as well.

58
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,380
So this is the formal application name, then your Tayside and Spidey.

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,630
So now we are seeing all these things in the logs that we trace down the request across the micro devices

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,230
and Gateway and using the Spinetta with trace down within the Microsoft Office.

61
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,910
That's fine.

62
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,250
But how about the UI?

63
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,670
What if we can have UI for this?

64
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,550
We just provide the press ID and it will provide us complete floor that from back to where the request

65
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,260
is going.

66
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:20,840
So for example, from Gateway to Service and from there to address service so that if we want to see

67
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,530
in the UI, then we need to use Zipkin.

68
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:30,190
And for that Zipkin is providing Zipkin server and that's what we are going to implement in the upcoming

69
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,970
lecture's.

70
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,350
So that's all for now.

71
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,180
We'll see you in the next lecture.

72
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,740
Thank you very much.
