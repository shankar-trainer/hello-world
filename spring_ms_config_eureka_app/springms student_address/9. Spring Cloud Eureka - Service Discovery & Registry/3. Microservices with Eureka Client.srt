Hello and welcome back after having the Eureka server.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,750
Now we need to configure our Microsoft offices so that they can register with the Eureka server.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,990
Now for the Eureka server, we have used the Eureka server.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:23,490
Dependency on our micro services can is client right because they are registering with the Eureka server.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,530
So in the micro services, we need to add the dependency as spring cloud starter Netflix's Eureka client.

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,520
So we need to add for the student and address micro services.

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,950
So add this dependencies in the bombed out XML for your all micro services.

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,560
Now up to providing these dependencies, let's go to the main class of our micro services.

9
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,200
So first, let's go with the address service application.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,040
And here we need to enable.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,970
Eureka client like this.

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,690
And saying we need to do for our student service.

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,300
So you know what, you a server, we have enabled and enable UDCA server and here we are in a building

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:20,320
with at Enable Eureka Clanged because these are our micro services and this will register with the Eureka

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,720
server.

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,770
So in the both the micro services, we will use the add enable Eureka client.

17
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,920
Now we have defined that this micro services need to register themselves with the Eureka server, but

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,490
what is the role of Eureka server that also we need to define?

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:36,850
Right.

20
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:44,010
So let's go to the application properties file and here we need to set the Eureka server.

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,920
You are so using the property you declined.

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,700
Service, you are ill, not default, John.

23
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:02,630
And here, Provida, you are Elaph Eureka Sarwan, so in our case, it's running in the local Muzzin

24
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,950
so local localhost and the board is eight seven six one slice eureka.

25
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:15,440
So this is the you are Elaph Eureka server at the localhost eight seven six one slice Eureka.

26
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,080
Now let me copy this and put same in our student microcircuits.

27
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,710
So you know what, micro services we need to do three things.

28
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:33,180
First, at the Utica, Glen Dependancy enable the Utica client and third, provide the jewel of Utica

29
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,440
server that is running in our local Muzzin.

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,290
So now we are all set with our Utica server and Utica clients, basically our micro services, our configuration

31
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,960
parties ready in the micro services.

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,390
So that's all for now will proceed further in the next lecture.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,890
Thank you very much.
