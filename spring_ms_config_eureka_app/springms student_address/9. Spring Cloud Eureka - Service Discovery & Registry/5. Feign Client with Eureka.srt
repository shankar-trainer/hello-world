00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,970
So now we are ready with the Eureka server and our micro services.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,550
So this is the faint light that we are using to make the call to our address service from the student

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,900
service to get the address details right.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,720
And here we are calling by using the you are a laboratory service.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,690
But now we should not be doing this because now we have UDCA server in place.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,140
So student service wants to communicate with address service.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,140
It should not use that you are allowed address service.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,720
Instead of that, it should use the name of the service that is registered in the Utica.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,320
See, this is the name of the address service address.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,460
That's service.

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,520
So this we need to use in our line.

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,990
So let's remove this.

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,360
You are completely we don't need it.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,760
And in the value we will provide the name of the service and this would exactly match with this one.

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,660
The case doesn't matter.

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,140
Uppercase, lowercase, that's fine.

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,390
Now we are good.

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,730
We don't need to change anything else.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,240
That's it.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,610
Let's run the unit customer first.

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,820
And then our micro services, so let's start the student and address micro services, so till it gets

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,680
started, let's do Posman.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,910
Let's hit this goodbye to get the student body.

25
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,090
Just click on the scene, see, we got the response.

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,490
But the important thing is that this address details are coming from the address service.

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,200
And for that, we have used a paying client and we provided the name of the service.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,220
And this is all working with the help of UDCA server.

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,210
We haven't referred to the You are the address service.

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,960
So this is all about UDCA server.

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,090
So whenever you're one micro service is calling another micro service, you just need to provide the

32
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,170
name of the service in your phone line.

33
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,970
That's it.

34
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:03,090
Rest of the things will work with the Utica server that will provide your micro service that you are

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,820
allowed the particular micro service, for example, in our case, this is the you are not address micro

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,210
service.

37
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,790
So Utica's server will provide this.

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,650
You are a little over micro service because in starting it will fetch the registry that.

39
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,820
What are the micro services registered with the Utica server.

40
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,950
On stratabound, each Migros service, it will fetch the registry from the Casadevall that what are

41
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,420
the micro services registered in the Utica server and its Jarrell's also it will obtain.

42
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,320
So that will help this micro service to communicate with the address service.

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,930
And this is applicable to your all micro services.

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,020
So this is all about service, discovery and resistivity, sprinklered, Eureka!

45
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,940
So that's all for now will proceed further in the next lecture.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,590
Thank you very much.
