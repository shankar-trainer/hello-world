Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,230
In this lecture, we will see what are the different states of a circuit breaker, Ken, how so?

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,410
Now you know that we have a switch and in this lecture we will see what are the different states the

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,400
can have.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,460
So here there are three different states of a switch or you can see a circuit breaker can help.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,360
The first is Clouzot.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,900
So the suite is closed and that means all calls are allowed.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,140
So in our example, student service is calling address service and Ipswitch is closed.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,180
That means all calls from student service to address service are allowed.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,710
The second state is open, if the suite is open, that means no calls allowed.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,410
So basically no calls from room service to address service are allowed.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,070
So this is the open state for work switch.

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,350
Now, the third state our suite can have is half open or you can zip partially open.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,740
So basically, it's not blocking all the calls and also it is not allowing all the calls, but it will

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,530
just allow some few number of calls to go from student to address service.

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,400
For example, our student service is calling the address service and the call rate is 100 per second.

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:28,420
So if the switches happen, then it will just allow 10 or 20 calls to go out of hundred this 10 or 20

18
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,290
we can configure.

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:36,640
It's up to us that how many calls we want to allow in the half open state to go from student to address

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,180
service.

21
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,280
So here, if the state is half open, that means it's not allowing all the calls and as well it is not

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,240
blocking all the 100 calls, but it's partially allowing a few calls to go from student to address service.

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,160
And that's the half open state for the circuit breaker or switch, whatever you say.

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:05,270
Now, these three states is in our hand, how we want to configure, we just need to set up a few residents

25
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,480
for the properties and we can configure these three different states that when we want to make the switch

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,660
closer, when we want to make the switch is open and when we want to make the switch as half open,

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,370
it's completely up to us.

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,170
And also how many calls we want to allow to go in the open.

29
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,230
One state that is basically partially allowing the calls, all things we can configure using the resilience

30
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,610
for the properties.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,820
Now, what are those properties?

32
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,670
That's what we are going to see in the next lecture, so that's all for now.

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,650
We'll see you in the next lecture.

34
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,060
Thank you very much.
