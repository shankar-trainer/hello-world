00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,660
In this lecture, we will see what is circuit breaker now for this lecture only.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,350
Forget about the spring board, spring cloud and micro services, because in this lecture we will understand

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,100
what is circuit breaker by taking the real world example.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,590
So here we have home and in our home, we have electronic items such as fridge, TV, as the washing

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,860
machine and many more.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,210
Right.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,020
And this is the electricity source here.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,710
We have one electrical switch.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,610
If this suite is closer to that means electricity is flowing into our home.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,540
If this switches open, that means electricity is not flowing in our home.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,060
So, for example, as of now, this which is closed.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,060
So electricity is flowing in our home.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,090
Now, see, we have some issue in our home, it may be higher voltage or any other reason, and because

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,070
of that, our fridge got damaged.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,610
And if this continues, then it may be possible that other electronics items may get damaged.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,250
So we don't want to have that right.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,600
So nowadays, in most of the homes, we have an electrical switch which will identify if there is an

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,610
issue in our home, it will automatically make this switch as open.

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,560
So if the suite is open, that means electricity will not flow in over a home.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,350
So that's total power cut in our home.

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,950
Nothing will work be to blight fan or any other electronic item.

23
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,290
By making the switch open, we are saving other electronic items in our home.

24
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,550
Our fridge got damaged, but at least we sell with other electronic items by getting damaged.

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,960
So this is a circuit breaker.

26
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:53,500
This electricity is blowing when the switch is closer and we brought this circuit by making this switch

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,220
as open.

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,320
Now, you may call the electrician, the guy will come and he will examine the home, if everything

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,500
is fine, then he will make the switch as closely.

30
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,310
So he switches closer.

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,510
Then again, electricity will flow into your home.

32
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:16,780
So this is a circuit breaker in context of electrical switch, we broke the circuit with the help of

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,910
this electrical switch.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,880
Now in the next lecture, we will see the circuit breaker in context of our micro services.

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,900
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,460
Thank you very much.
