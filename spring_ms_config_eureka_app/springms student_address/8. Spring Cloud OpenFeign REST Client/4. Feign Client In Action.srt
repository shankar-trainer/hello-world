00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,160
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,960
Now we are ready with our very first feel, inclined to make the call to address service from the student

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,380
service.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,040
So now let's run the micro services in our local mussy.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,240
So let's start the student service and at the service.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,300
Now lets them to Posman and let's call DeSapio to get the student body.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,100
We got the response.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,220
See, we are getting the address details as well, but now this time this address details are coming

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,310
using the open thing that we have Usrah in the student service.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,250
This is what we are calling and this is actually calling the address service.

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,020
Using this, you are a lot better service.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,720
And this you are right.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,040
And that's why we are getting the address.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,920
It is for that particular student.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,080
So this is how we can use the phone line, the springboard application to make the rest calls to other

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,190
services now.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,290
So, for example, you want to call another service.

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,180
So what do you need to do?

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,000
Is that just create another front line that is basically an interface or here inside the package and

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,530
do the mapping like this?

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,570
That's it for another Microsoft Office.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,260
Or it can be any third party service as well.

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,110
It doesn't matter.

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,110
You just need you are all mapping and attitude matter like this in the declaratively.

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,850
So this is all about sprinklered, open-faced and how to use in the spring wood application, so that's

26
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,510
all but now will proceed further in the next lecture.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,980
Thank you very much.
