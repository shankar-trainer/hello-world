00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,830
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,640
Now we are all set with our pre filter, so let's test it out.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,920
But before that, let's put one point in our filter or here and one point in our student controller.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,980
So this is inside our student service.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,450
Now, first, we need to start the Eureka server and we will start the EPA gateway in debug mode and

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,810
also student service in the department.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,640
And let's start the address service.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,180
Ignore this error.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,390
Let's start the service and wait for few seconds.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,560
Let's jump to Eureka.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,140
So just now, get with your let's reload.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,210
Now we are all set, let's jump to both men and this is our goodbye for this one.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,170
So in the headlines, we will put authorities on.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,870
See, the value is ABC.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,560
OK, just let me tell you, I am passing now on the same.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,580
Let's go to see here it is coming and let's check the logs for our Epper Gateway, what we are seeing.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,750
So we have type over here authorization, so let's correct it out, this one.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,460
What here and here as well.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
Let's ignore this one.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,030
Let's stop the EPA gateway.

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,200
Let's start it, we are gaining the department.

22
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,180
This was the typo, so ignore it.

23
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,470
Let's turn to Eureka and see if we are all good.

24
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,970
Yes, now let's hit this request again.

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,690
And let's take the logs.

26
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,990
We are getting the ABC see now just click on the effort to pass the request to next point.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,640
Now we are getting into the student service, you see the control coming to this particular gate mapping

28
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,660
that is inside our student service now.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,790
Just click on the effort.

30
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,010
We got the response here.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,180
So what we did over here is that we have this briefing tour before the EPA gets around the request to

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,810
our students.

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,720
So this is our three filter.

34
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,890
Now, in the next lecture, we will see the post filter.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,950
So that's all for now.

36
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,770
Will proceed further in the next lecture.

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,210
Thank you very much.
