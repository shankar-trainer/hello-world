Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,370
In this lecture, we will create the API Gateway application, so that is basically a springboard application.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,750
So let's create the new springboard application.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,810
And give the name is Epper Gateway.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,280
Provide the group as common as Cloud Artefact, a gateway server API gateway.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,770
This is the package we want to click on the next.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,940
Now, to add the gateway dependency, just search for Gateway and add this dependency, Solier Spring

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,640
was providing a gateway that is all, but now it's in the maintenance more.

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,510
So we are going to use the latest one.

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,860
That is Spring Cloud API Gateway.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,260
So select this one now.

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,480
But it'd be a gateway application will use the Eureka server to allow the request to appropriate service.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,720
So for that we need to register our API Gateway application to Eureka server.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,350
So for that, we need to add the Eureka discovery line to this Gateway application.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,960
Now just click on the next and finish.

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,890
Now, let's open the application properties of our EPA, get the application.

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:25,490
So first thing we will said the Salvador report is nine zero nine zero, because we are going to run

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,480
this EPA Goodway application on board nine zero nine zero one local Muzzin.

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,050
Now, the next is application nine.

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,230
The EPA gateway.

21
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,870
Now we need to register this gateway application to Eureka server so that we know, right, what we

22
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,670
need to do in the main class, we need to annotate with enable.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,930
Yurick, our client.

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,610
And we need to provide that you are a of Eureka server application DOT properties file, so let's copy

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,740
it from one of our micro services.

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,620
So let me copy this, you are a Eureka server and provide what here?

27
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,220
So this is what we have done, we created the EPA get the application, we set the port application

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,770
name and we registered it with Eureka Server by providing you all of Eureka.

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,470
And we enable it in our meaningless.

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,710
Now, furthermore, the configuration we will see in the next lecture, so that's all for now, will

31
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,990
proceed further in the next lecture.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,490
Thank you very much.
