00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,230
Hello and welcome back here.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,710
Our address service is reading the properties using config server, but the profile is default.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,490
So what if we want to read the profile specific properties in our address service?

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,500
So, for example, the profile or you can go with our broad profile.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,850
So that's what we are going to do in this lecture.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,620
So let's turn to our local get people and let's copy this one.

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,830
Now, let's provide this name so to your microcircuits name, hyphen your profile.

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,630
Say, for example, the profile for our address microcircuits.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,400
So this is the name of all my groceries.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,980
I found your profile in our example.

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,200
They let me open it.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,280
Notepad plus plus.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,330
Now these two are having the same set of properties.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,530
So to distinguish and to verify that it's reading the specific to their environment, let's put one

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,870
distinct property set.

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,850
For example, address dard dist equal to Distin so this property will read in the address service.

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,930
I will use the profile as there so that we can verify that it's picking up the profile specific properties

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,080
file and that's what coming through the config server.

19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,840
So this is our local report.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,650
Yeah, it came see at the service.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,050
I wonder what properties this is in the local getable.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,140
So that's fine.

23
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,930
If you don't commit live it like this, only it will work.

24
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,560
Now, let's turn to our address microcircuits.

25
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,360
This is the bootstrappers properties.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
And here we need to define that which profile we want to fetch.

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:55,180
Basically properties for which profile we want to have so far that spring cloud, dot config, dot profile

28
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,380
equal to profiling in our example, it's do.

29
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,740
So this is the property you need to use sprinklered profile equal to do OK.

30
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,420
And that's what we have provided over here.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,080
Hi Funday.

32
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,760
Our microcircuits ning.

33
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,500
I found out what properties.

34
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,500
So this is what you need to do.

35
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,850
Now let's read this property, address the artist, support that.

36
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,560
What we can do.

37
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,890
Let's have one day stepa in our address controller.

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,360
So we get mapping.

39
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,090
Celestis.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,700
Public string dist.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,580
So let's read this property in the address controller.

42
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,360
Add value.

43
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,010
This is the property and.

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,750
Private string dist.

45
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,980
Let's return this whatever property we are reading.

46
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,650
Yes, now we are all good, so you, Nagasawa and conflicts are really running, so we are good order.

47
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,730
Let's start the address service.

48
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,100
Until then, let's jump to Bowsman.

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,790
So this is the model for our conflicts are our adversaries, let's say profilings the.

50
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,740
See, we are getting the properties and this is what we have in their profile only address, not Istiklal

51
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,320
do testing.

52
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,790
Now let's see the address service.

53
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,910
So sless address and test.

54
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,850
So you've got the testing, that means a dressmaker's service is using the profile and it's reading

55
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,820
from here using the config server, so that's what we have.

56
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,070
This is profile specific or you can set environment specific.

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,990
So this is all you need to do, your microcircuits, name, hyphen, profile, do you know what example

58
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,730
and this is the property you need to set in your Microsoft Office.

59
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,650
So this is applicable to all the Microsoft offices you have here.

60
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,200
We just have a service as an example, but you need to do in all your micro services.

61
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,750
So this is how you can read the profile specific properties using config server, so that's all for

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,150
now.

63
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,030
We'll see you in the next lecture.

64
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,530
Thank you very much.
