00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,210
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,550
In this lecture, we'll create the address, micro surveys out of this university monolithic application,

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,410
and that will be a springboard application.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,750
So let's go for it.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Just click on the file new and spin starter project.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,300
So here you are, the name is Address Service.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:32,180
So this is our address microcircuits and group is coming to us, cloud whatever you want to give artifact

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:38,380
his address service, this copson address service and this is the picture, click on the next.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,500
And here will select the dependencies.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,860
Bicycle drivers, spring and spring.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,330
This is because our address microcircuits will have the recipes and it will connect to MySQL database

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
using the spring data G.P.A..

13
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,150
This is the Springwood version I'm using because this is the latest.

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,870
When I'm recording this lecture, just click on the next and finish.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,670
It may take a few seconds or a minute to download the dependencies now let let's first configure our

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,200
application dot properties so from our monolithic application, let's copy the database properties.

17
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,650
So this will be used by sprint data --.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,870
Now for each Migros service, we will provide a name to that particular microcircuits and that will

19
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,190
be unique across all of our micro services.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,090
So here we will use spring dot application.

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,650
Not name and will give it as address service.

22
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,860
Now we are going to run a couple of micro services in our local Muzzin and also we are going to run

23
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,770
the sprinklered cloud projects as well.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,030
So we will run this address.

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,210
Microsoft is on board eight zero eight two in our local machine so that we will do using the server

26
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,900
DOT board and provide a value is Ejiro data.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,390
So these are the Maseko database properties.

28
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,260
This is the Microsoft Office name and this is board on which this Microsoft Office will run in our local

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,590
machine.

30
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,260
Now, let's create a couple of packages inside the Assad regime in.

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,110
So let's first start with controller.

32
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:30,560
So-called dart in was thought controller and let me copy this part, because we will create a couple

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,300
of models as well and the next is service.

34
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:48,380
Another one is entity that will be having over, and it is for the spring data, Gibeah and.

35
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,250
We will be having one more package for the repository for spring data repositories.

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,090
Now we will be having two packages for request and response model classes for our address microcircuits.

37
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,640
So these packages as up now are blank.

38
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,170
Now let's go to our main class that is addressed service application.

39
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:25,620
And we will copy from our monolithic application this complete thing for the configuration components

40
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:34,230
can and and enable repositories because we have the same kind of structure for the packages controller

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,740
and service inside the components, skin and scandal.

42
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,650
And it is inside this package and enable the repositories that we have inside this particular package.

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,380
So here is the structure of our address service is ready.

44
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,480
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

45
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,830
Thank you very much.
