Hello and welcome to Discourse, first of all, thank you so much for taking this course before we start

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,100
building micro services with spring board and spring cloud.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,970
Let me give you a sort introduction to the calls.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,290
The very first thing is for structure, this course is all about building micro services with spring

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,670
board and spring cloud.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,450
So first you will learn what is monolithic application and how to create micro services out of your

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,860
monolithic application.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,790
This goes a step by step tutorial to build a micro services with spring board and spring cloud.

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:46,740
Someone has rightly said that don't judge a book by its cover and the same thing is applicable for discourse,

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,790
discourse is having four hours of content.

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,750
So I would like to request you, what, at least 30 to 50 percent of the calls and then come up with

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,080
your constructive feedback?

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,930
I'm always looking for the constructive feedback to improve the quality.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:09,400
The next phase of the course, some students referred to learning speed, and some students prefer to

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,750
learning slow speed in this course.

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,100
I tried my best to keep the medium pace targeting all kind of students whenever required.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,330
I slow down my pace to make you understand the topic in a better way.

18
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,990
Still, if you think that pace of the course is fast or slow, then in the video player you have option

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,390
to either increase or decrease the speed.

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,010
Source code and other resources that we are going to use in this course that we will find inside the

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,640
lectures and you can download them as well.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,660
English is not my mother tongue, so I hope before taking the course, you have watched the previous

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,500
videos to take my teaching style and English pronunciation.

24
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,490
Yeah, that's the introduction to the cause, and from next lecture, we will start our journey up micro

25
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,220
services with Springwood and Sprinklered.
