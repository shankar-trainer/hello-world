00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:10,680
So now we are ready with our student and address services, so let's run the both services in the local

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,720
Muzzin, so let's start the address service and student service.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:24,640
Wait for a few seconds till it get started and let them do Posman, so here will hit out the student

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,420
service, getting the student by ID and past ideas one.

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,270
Now, let's call this giddap.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,130
We got the response.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,120
Check it out.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,670
See, along with the student it is.

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,160
We are getting the address details as well.

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,290
The reason is that inside our student service, we are calling the address service, using the Web client

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,890
and that's what we are populating while giving back the student details in this particular model class.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,790
And if you want to check it out, then just go to the address service logs.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,010
And here you can see it is going inside the gate by ID.

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,390
And the idea of address is one that is basically address ID equal to one.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,550
So here we are calling the student service and internal student service is calling the address service,

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,240
using the vaped line and that's why we are seeing these logs of address service.

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,810
So this is how our micro services can communicate with each other.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,470
You can use this template.

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,520
If you are familiar with, then you can use Web client as well.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,600
But there is a more efficient way and more easy way to do this as well.

22
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,450
And that's what we are going to do in the upcoming lectures.

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,690
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,310
Thank you very much.
