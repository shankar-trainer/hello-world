00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,310
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:11,220
Now our student and addressed micro services are ready, so here for the student, we are having the

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,210
address details.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,030
So we need to call the address service from the student service to get the address details.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,990
So the scenario is we need to call the address service from our student service now in Springwood to

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,100
make the right calls.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,850
Generally, we use rest template, but from spring five onwards, it's not recommended to use race template

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,620
because Spring itself stated that in the future it will get depreciated.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,810
So here it's recommended to use the Web client instead of rest template.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,720
And that's what we are going to use in this class.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,570
So to use the Web client, we need to add one dependency in the bombed out example of student service,

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,150
and that is Springwood Flux.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,800
So make sure you are adding this dependency in the bombed out similar student service.

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,100
Now let's create the pin of Web client.

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,570
So you never mean class.

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,280
That is student service application.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,660
Let's create one being of that client.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,330
So.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,120
Lynette.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,490
Just this one from the reactive package.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,530
Web client.

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,090
Market with at been.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,090
Now, to make the call to address service, we need to have you are a lot better service, right?

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,040
So let's go to the application or properties of certain service and here, say a prayer service.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,610
You are El.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,070
Equal to localhost.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,780
Ejiro, it, too.

28
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,900
This is the port on which our address, Microsoft Office, will run in our local Muzzin Sless AIPA sless

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,610
address.

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,050
So this is the you are a local address, Microsoft Office.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:02,100
Now let's read this property in our main class using the add value annotation.

32
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,850
So that is.

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,440
Address.

34
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,380
Service, you are a.

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,930
Let's import it value and here.

36
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,910
Let's provide this property.

37
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,400
Now we will use this model to create the meaning of that land so that client.

38
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:37,230
Equal to the blind dot and call the metal builder here, you will see one method that is builder.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Now we need to say don't because you are right.

40
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,910
So we will set this one that we are reading from the application DOT properties and call the builder

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,280
matter.

42
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,860
So this will give us the object of the client.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,130
Let's return it.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,270
And this is what we are going to use throughout this student service application.

45
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,710
So let's have been of this web outlined in our student service.

46
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,350
So in this room service, let's automate this.

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,300
So using this line, we will make the rest calls to our address service.

48
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,170
Also, you can use this web design to make wrist calls to other services as well.

49
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,450
You just need to create another Benoff Web client and provider you all of that service.

50
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,160
So this Web client is the same kind of thing that we are using race template.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,670
It's just that rich template is going to be deprecated and Web client is recommended to use.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,550
So that's why we are using the Web client in the schools.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,770
Now, in the next lecture, we will see how to use this Web client to make the rest calls.

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,330
In our example, it is called to address Microsoft Office.

55
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,530
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,730
Thank you very much.
