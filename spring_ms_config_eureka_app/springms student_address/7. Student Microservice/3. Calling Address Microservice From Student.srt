00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,130
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:09,540
In this lecture, we will call the address surveys from the student surveys to get the address details.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,960
So let's go to the address surveys and inside the address, comptroller say we will call this GDP to

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,930
get the address by IDY.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,140
So this is written in the details at Resiled Street and City.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,150
So this will get in the former top Gissen.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,050
So let us use the same model class from the address service to our student service.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,360
So let me pasteboard here and let's open this, let's close this one from the address service.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,300
Now here we don't have any declasse address and that is obvious.

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,200
We don't need this.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,680
This is just to convert Jason to over Bojo class.

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,190
That's it.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:56,120
Whatever Jason responds will get from the extra service that will convert into this particular object.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,640
That is a stress response model class.

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,440
Now, let's go to student service.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,420
Let me close this controller and let us use this Web line to call our address service.

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,830
So let's have a one method.

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,570
To call the address service, say we are getting a stress response.

19
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:23,380
Get addressed by ID and here we have long address ID.

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:32,570
Let me maximize this now, let's use that line to call the reservists of a line to get.

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,320
And we need to pass the euro.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,460
Let's open the address controller.

23
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,710
So this is the euro just copied from here.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,140
Let's get my ID.

25
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,850
And we have one part variable as well.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,130
Right?

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,540
So that is ID basically address.

28
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,000
So here we have a tragedy.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,020
Just can't get it.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:03,820
So this is our complete you are right now, we need to call the retry matter on that and body to mono.

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,980
And provide the class, so in our example, we have a stress response, not class.

32
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,280
So this will return the model of a dress response, so let's sell.

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,740
Model of a dress responds.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,990
Let me bring it down or here, let's import, so this is from the reactive package, if you see OK,

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,820
so this is a completely different topic, switching reactive.

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,040
So we are not going into that because discourse is all about micro devices with spring and spring cloud.

37
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,420
And this reactive part is completely a different topic.

38
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,370
So let's not mix up these things.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,880
So using this more of a stress response, let's return the object of a stress response class or call

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,240
the blog matter and return it.

41
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,830
That's it.

42
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,210
So while creating the Web bean we have already provided, you are right over here, right?

43
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,840
So now we just need to provide this you are only or here and our part equal value.

44
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,460
That's it.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,150
Now, let's call this method while getting the student details.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,210
So inside this object, we are returning the student details.

47
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,530
Right.

48
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,390
And here we have address attributes.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,480
So let's go object of.

50
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,120
Address response.

51
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:51,090
And inside that, we have at least three density, so we don't need this duplicate filter here.

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,040
Let's remove them.

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,490
And getters and setters as well.

54
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,890
Now, let's create getters and setters for a dress response.

55
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,280
Now, let's go back to the student service and here let's modify a few things quickly.

56
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,530
So student.

57
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,200
Getting the student by ID and here, let's create the new object of student response.

58
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,370
Like this.

59
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,560
Past the student.

60
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,400
Now, inside this student response, we need to set the address response, so let's call the response

61
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,840
and here we will call the matter get addressed by Eddie.

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,470
And inside this one entity class, we address ID.

63
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,950
We are good over here.

64
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,970
So what we are doing is that along with the Syrian detainees inside this glass, we are witnessing the

65
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,290
atrocities as well.

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,850
And for that, we are using this particular model plus from that address service.

67
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,050
So we are good over here.

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,370
And while creating this as well, you can do the same thing.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,350
OK, let me copy this.

70
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,170
And after creating the student.

71
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,940
Let's have this kind of thing, let's create the new object of student order here.

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,730
And let's return this.

73
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,860
So after creating the student, we are returning the student details along with the address details

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,270
by getting the address details and we are calling that address service.

75
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,380
While getting this done by the as well, what we are doing is that we are getting the details using

76
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,230
this repository and we are putting the address, it is by calling the address service.

77
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,850
So we are all set with our student service and address service, so that's all for now, will proceed

78
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,680
further in the next lecture.

79
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,880
Thank you very much.
