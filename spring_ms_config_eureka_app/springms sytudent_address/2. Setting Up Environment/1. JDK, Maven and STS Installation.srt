00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,220
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,980
In this lecture, we will download and set up JDK apartment and spring tools in our local Muzzin.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,450
So first, let's go with.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,690
That is our development kit and this is the official website of Oracle, and from here you can download

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:27,580
the dedicate in this cause I'm going to use it, which is coming at free cost by Oracle because this

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,240
is our personal and development use or you can say educational use.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,200
If you want to use Harverson, then get it, you can go with open Jadeja that is coming under the open

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,010
source license.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,140
So it's up to you in this course.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,730
I'm going to use it.

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,060
So download adjudicate according to your operating system, Linux, Windows, or make it up to you.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,730
So download and install in your local machine.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,180
Now the next thing is to do so.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,610
In this course we are going to use the Apache Marwin.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,160
If you are familiar with Criddle, you can go for it as well.

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,030
So this is the official website of the bottom of it.

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,550
And from here you can download the Apache, Marvin, whatever it was and you can see you can go for

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,700
it.

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,050
So download according to your operating system and install in your local machine.

20
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:21,740
The next thing is Idy, you can go with Eclipse the idea, and that means whatever you prefer, it's

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,440
up to you in this cause I'm going to use Steer's that is spring tonsured.

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,330
So this is the official website of ideas.

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,790
And here you can download these ideas according to your operating system, Linux, Mac or Windows.

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,630
It's up to you.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,000
If you are familiar with the intelligencia and you want to go for it, it's up to you in this course,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,290
I'm going to use the ideas.

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,380
So I would recommend download and install ideas in your local machine from the official website of Stass.

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,890
So download and install these three softwares in your local machine, according to your operating system,

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,450
after downloading and installing, if you are a Windows user, then search for the environment variables.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,520
And here you see system environment variables.

31
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,940
In that one step, you will see environment variables.

32
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,690
So here we need to create two new environment variables.

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,590
The first is a home, which is basically part over JDK and the name is Dullahan, and this is the path

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,340
to JDK.

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,040
Whatever is in your local machine, at what location it is being installed and make sure you are not

36
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,900
giving the Bindaree in this part.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,880
Only you need to get.

38
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,290
The second is home to home.

39
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,750
The name is M2M and this is where your apartment is installed and make sure you are not giving the bin

40
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,730
directly in the path.

41
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,470
So up to creating these two new environment variables, the next thing is we need to send in the existing

42
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,760
part environment variable so this will be already exist in your machine.

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,800
So just edit it and put your two environmental variables like this person, date home, percentage lesbian

44
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,120
and same for your marine part, came to homes lesbian.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,210
So this is all you need to do, download JDK, Apache, Mudvayne and SD and install them after that,

46
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,370
create the two environment variables and set those in your party environment variable like this.

47
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,970
So make sure you are doing this before we start the next lecture.

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,620
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

49
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,210
Thank you very much.
