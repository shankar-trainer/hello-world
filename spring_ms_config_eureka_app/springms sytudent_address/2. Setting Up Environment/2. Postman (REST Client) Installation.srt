Hello and welcome back to Historic Steps, we need a right in this course we are going to use Posman

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,280
to hit the right steps.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,970
If you are familiar with any other Esterline like advancer land or any other tool, you can go for it.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,250
But in this course, we are going with Posman to hit the steps.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,250
So this is the official website of Posman downloadable and according to your operating system and install

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,240
in your local machine.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:38,040
After installing Posman, open it and you will see the screen like this, so here we can file recipes

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,510
for different ATIP methods provided over here, get pulled, forced and delete.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,980
And here we can provide the URL, query bottoms and also we can provide the body as well.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,070
That is basically our payload in the format of Jason.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,830
So download and install the postman will proceed further in the next lecture.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,180
Thank you very much.
