00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,230
In this lecture, we will download and install music in our local machine.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,480
In this course, we are going to use music as the database connecting to our Springwood application.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,610
So here is the official website of my school.

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,370
Just go over here and download the music world according to your operating system.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:32,060
So this includes my school server and my second workbench MySQL server is required because we are going

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:39,110
to run the database in our local machine and to execute the queries on that server, we need UI that

8
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,380
is my workbench to execute the queries.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,150
So download and install, according to your operating system, after installing it, if you are a Windows

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,460
user, then go inside your program files.

11
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,800
You will see this folder being created.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,090
MiSeq will go inside the physical server inside the bin.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,920
Here you will see one that is mythically to start the mystical server in our local machine.

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:12,100
We need to run this file so it does Double-Click, and it will start the physical server in our local

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,520
machine.

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,690
If this is not working for you, then there is another option as well, the search for the services

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,820
and inside the services go for Mystikal.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,090
You see or hear just right, click and start.

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,680
So this will start the sequel server in our local machine, if you check the properties, it is pointing

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,210
to only my second or the lose.

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,600
That's what we just now seen.

22
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,260
So now my second story is running in our local machine, so let's connect to it using my second workbench,

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,500
so open the bicycle workbench.

24
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,400
And you need to make the connection.

25
00:01:53,330 --> 00:02:00,560
Localhost, you can you can name anything hostis localhost, this is the by default port for the local

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,120
bicycle, Sawatari three 06 Rudie the username and password.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,380
Whatever you give during the installation, click on the disconnection test is successful.

28
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,060
So we are good to go here.

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,340
Just click on here to connect to local database.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,450
So here are the default schemas provided by bicycle.

31
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,170
That's fine as we proceed in the course, we will create another schema for our micro services.

32
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,280
So make sure before the next lecture you download and install music in your local machine, so that's

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,000
all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

34
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,290
Thank you very much.
