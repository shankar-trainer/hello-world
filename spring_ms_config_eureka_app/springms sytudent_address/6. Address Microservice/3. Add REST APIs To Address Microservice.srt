Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,300
In this lecture, we will address topics in our address microcircuits.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,540
So this is the address Canterlot and here we will add to this DP's one is to create the address and

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,060
another one is to get the address by idee.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,710
So this is a post matter and this is gatepost.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,440
For the time being, I have added this to appears in the air traffic controller and here we have a service.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,160
Ordover So whatever it is we want to create that we will get inside this object top model class.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,720
That is basically a very crisp payload in the form of Jason and this model.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,180
Plus we have created in the previous lecture and that's what we are passing to our service layer.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,620
Now here we will create the address using the address repository.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,190
So let's create the new object of address.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,140
And let's assign the values that are coming in this model class in the format of Jason.

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,040
So we will set the straight.

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,160
GetSet.

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,280
It restored said City.

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:24,080
Gets it now here we will use the address repository and using this, we will save the address.

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,740
Now, let's return the.

18
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:36,280
Response, so that is the object of this model class, we have already seen a direct response past object

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,570
of address and class, and we have this contractor who is converting from entity class to this response

20
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,320
model class.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,710
So this is to create the address.

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,220
Now let's take the another one that is getting the address by I.D. We are getting the idea of the address

23
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,330
in the part variable, and that's what we are passing to Overservice Layer.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,660
Here we have one logger using the logging factory.

25
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:09,160
Now what we will do, we will use this address repository and we will find the address by ID.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,050
So fine by it.

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,810
But the idea that is coming in the request, get it.

28
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,790
And here we are getting the object of the address.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,610
And like this, we will return.

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,790
Using the model class that is a stress response, Nardella past the object of entity class that is addressed,

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,710
not Java.

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,060
So these are two APIs, one to create the address and another one is to get the address.

33
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,720
So that's all for now will proceed further in the next lecture.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,980
Thank you very much.
