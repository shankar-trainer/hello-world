00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,160
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:10,620
Let's proceed further with our address microcircuits, so from our monolithic application, let's copy

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,470
the glass that is addressed, not Java.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,060
And let's inside our address microcircuits.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,810
We don't need to put those two into the glass inside the address my groceries, because this and the

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,170
glass will go to Student Microcircuits and that we will see in the upcoming lectures.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,620
Now, let Scoppetta address repository from here and put inside this package OPOWER.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,040
Address my groceries.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,860
Now let's create the.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,850
One model calls for the request to create the address to create address request.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,550
So here we will put the couple of attributes like Private String St..

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,140
And city.

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,060
So this is all required to create the address.

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,110
Let's go getters and setters for these two fields.

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,620
Now, let's have one response class to return the address details, and that is a response.

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,470
That will be having the same set of attributes.

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,860
And one more that is address ID.

18
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,610
Let's get us insiders for this as well.

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,700
And we will be having one constructor for this.

20
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:53,180
To convert the object of a dress into the glass to this model glass that is a dress response, not Jawa,

21
00:01:53,690 --> 00:02:02,550
let's import the address and here will do address I'd call to address dard gaited.

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,390
And.

23
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,520
This large, critical to address, does not get straight.

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,720
This Darte CD.

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,930
Address DOT gets get.

26
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,920
This is to give the response back to the consumer from over entity class, we cannot return this entity

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,400
class, right?

28
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,910
So we need the model class and this is what it is converting.

29
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,590
Now, let's move ahead and let's go to the remote controller.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,930
See a dress controller.

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,650
Let's market with raised controller.

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
At the request mapping.

33
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:55,530
See Sless address, less Epper or let's say Sless AIPA, less address.

34
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,570
Let's import risk, so here we will develop the risk types for the address microcircuits so that we

35
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,190
will see in the next lecture.

36
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,040
Now let's create a service.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,140
Let's market with a service in addition.

38
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:24,920
So now our address microcircuits is almost ready, we just need to have restabilize inside our address

39
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,220
controller and that we will see in the next lecture.

40
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,320
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,610
Thank you very much.
