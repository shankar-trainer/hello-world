00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,980
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:09,510
In this lecture, we will create the Eureka server, so that is basically a springboard application.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,860
So let's go for it.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,790
Let's create a new springboard application and let's give the name as UDCA server.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,750
Let's have this artifact, and this is the group that's change the Gibson and this is the package we

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,950
want to have inside it.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,760
Click on the next now here, search for UDCA.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,170
And we need to add this dependancy spring Eureka server.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,350
Click on the next and finish.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,120
So this will take a few seconds maybe to build a project and download the dependencies.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,890
Now let's open up on a good example of this Eureka server, and here you will see the dependency.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,350
So this is sprinklered starter Netflix's Eureka Server.

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,790
Now let's them do application dot properties.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,650
So here we need to set a couple of properties, the first thing is bolt on which our Eureka server will

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,950
run in the local machine.

16
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,490
Now it's recommended to use the port as eight, seven, six one.

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,580
So let's set the port as Savol Dart board equal to eight, seven, six one.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,430
Now we need to provide the application name, so spring application name equal to Eureka Server.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,460
Now, here, we also need to add two more properties, but as of now, we are not adding them.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,680
We will come to that part later.

21
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,190
I'm not directly adding this to because first you need to understand that why we need to add those two

22
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,870
properties.

23
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,900
So we'll come to that part later.

24
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,790
Leave it for now and open the main class of this Utica Castevet.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,530
And we need to enable the Eureka server, so we are saying that this is not the normal springboard application,

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,810
but this is the Eureka server, so how the annotation is attainable.

27
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,760
Eureka server.

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,080
Now, we don't need to do anything else because this is not the normal Springwood application, so we

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,700
will not be having any of this DPAs over here, right.

30
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,270
So live it all things as it is.

31
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,460
This property is part we will come to later, part in the course up to two or three lectures maybe.

32
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,820
But for now, you just need to enable the Eurekas or the middle class, and that's it.

33
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,210
So now we are ready with the Eureka server, so we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,770
Thank you very much.
