00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,460
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,870
So now we are ready with the Eureka server and our micro services, so let's run the Eureka server first.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,880
So let's start the Eureka server Springwood application.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,270
Now, you need to remember this order.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,950
We first need to start the Eureka server and then our micro services.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,870
So what happens when you start your micro services, right?

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,560
It will read this property, whatever you are, you provided for your Rijeka server and it will try

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,320
to connect and register with this Utica's server.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,750
So this is not running.

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,720
Then it will not be able to register with the Eureka server.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,400
So after starting the Eureka server, let's start over student and address micro services.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,420
So let's wait for them to get started.

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,110
Until then, let's go to Browsr.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,450
Let's hit the Utica when you are.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,450
That is localhost and eight, seven, six, one.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,220
See, this is the judicature again here you see that what are the services and its instances are registered

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,310
with the Utica.

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,330
You see this address service running on the port eight zero eight two.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,110
This is the student service running on the port.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,330
Ejiro Ejiro.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,280
So this is the address name coming from the application DOT properties file whatever we have right.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,110
For the particular micro service.

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,380
So our micro services have registered themselves with the Eureka server, but look at this, this is

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,970
the Eureka server application.

25
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,910
This is not our Microsoft Web site.

26
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,230
But here what happens, Eureka server itself registered with the Eurekas.

27
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,560
Edward.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,340
So this is not we want to have right, we don't want to register UDCA server itself with the Eureka

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,270
server because this is not the Microsoft Office, so we don't want to have Discovery for our Eureka

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,490
server like this.

31
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,640
So what we need to do let's go back to the application.

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,700
Let's stop all the services and all the.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,840
Things including the Utica's.

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:14,950
Now, let's open the application or properties file for Unica server, and if you remember in one of

35
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,010
the previous lectures when we created this Eureka server, right.

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,000
I told you that we will come here back for the two properties.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,290
And this is the reason that we want to exclude UDCA server from registering with the Eureka server itself.

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,660
So here what we will do, we will set the properties you record outlined.

39
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,410
Let's stop all the things, make sure nothing is running after you register.

40
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,640
Eureka, equal to falls, so this property we need to set.

41
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,290
The next is Ulrika Klein.

42
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,510
FEG.

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,730
Registry.

44
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,650
Equal to falls.

45
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,200
Here is the table, let's correct it out.

46
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,070
So this is what we are saying that don't register this service with the Utica and don't fit the registry.

47
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:21,810
Now, let's start the Utica server after that address my groceries and student, my groceries.

48
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,510
Let's wait for them to get started.

49
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,920
Let's go to Browsr, let's reloader Utica.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,700
Address reservist that we see what the service is now registered with the Utica and we don't see the

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,060
Utica survey, so we excluded the Utica Sarovar from registering with the Utica Sarovar itself.

52
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:53,960
And hence we need to provide these two properties in the application or properties file for our Utica

53
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,530
server.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,060
So this is how micro services will get registered with the Utica.

55
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,120
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,500
Thank you very much.
