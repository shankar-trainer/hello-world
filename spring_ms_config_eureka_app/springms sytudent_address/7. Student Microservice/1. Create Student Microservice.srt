00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,390
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,640
In this lecture, we will create the student micro service out of this university monolithic application.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,500
So let's go for it and let's create the new springboard application.

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,440
Let's give the name is student service.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,960
And the group come in people's cloud and the artifact is student service led, so discipline is in service

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,430
and the packages is coming up next year.

7
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:44,300
We let the mystical spring liturgy and spring web dependencies and the springboard worthiness to fall

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,340
to finish.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,990
Let's wait for a few seconds to set up the project.

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,240
It's downloading some of the dependencies and building the project.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,140
Now let's go to the same resources, our application properties.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,160
And here we will put properties for database Conexant and service name and port.

13
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,790
So let's copy from address microsatellites all the properties in the student micro surveys.

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,270
This will remain same.

15
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,690
And our microcircuits name that is basically being application name is student service.

16
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,650
And this will run on board eight zero eight zero.

17
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,550
So this is the name of the application and this is the port on which it will run in our local machine.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,080
Now let's copy packages from our monolithic application.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,470
So this is I am going to make the things faster.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,610
So let's copy all the packages and put inside the student micro service.

21
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,010
And in the.

22
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,050
Main class.

23
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:01,370
Let's go and additions that we have in our address service, so let me copy all because of a structure

24
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,170
is seen.

25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,000
So this is components for controller services and entities can in repository.

26
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,000
Now, let's jump to our packages.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,230
So here's what we will do.

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,000
We will remove the address entity because here we don't need anything related to address.

29
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,810
OK, so let's address entity because this is too micro service.

30
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,530
So whatever dependencies we have on the address, we need to remove.

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,700
So here we have reference to address entity with one to one mapping.

32
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,580
So now instead of this, we will change it to long address it.

33
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,240
So this will be normal.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,030
Add column annotation and mapping.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
This will be not the one to one mapping.

36
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:52,160
Now, even this is what we will not do, the mapping one-to-one, but we will map it like normal column

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,330
that we have in our student table, like we have done for our last name, email and others.

38
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:04,640
So here, let me remove this and let's go getters and setters for this field that we have address ID.

39
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,970
Now, we are good over here in the same way we will remove this address repository.

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,450
Now, let's jump to request so here we will not get done story density in the request.

41
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,690
Instead of this, we will get the address.

42
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,140
So this address, it will be existing in our address table.

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,490
So we are not going to create the address from this student office.

44
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:37,340
We will create the address from the address service and we will provide the address idy to our student

45
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,000
microsatellites.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,940
So this will be already present in our address table.

47
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,990
This is basically our existing address ID in the address table.

48
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,920
So let me remove this and get us in status for the address ID.

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,910
The read that said, we are good over here now in the response.

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,370
So here we are getting the street and CD from the address object that we had inside our student entity

51
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,870
class, but just now we removed this right.

52
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,970
So we also need to remove this.

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,200
So here we just get those to details now, how to get the street and city basically address details

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,180
and how to map out here that we will see in the upcoming Lichter's.

55
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,420
For now live.

56
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,170
This feels like as it is and we will come to this point later.

57
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,030
Now, in the student service, we don't need a address repository, let's remove this and we are not

58
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,230
going to create the address from here, so let's remove this as well.

59
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,900
And here we will set the address ID.

60
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,280
And that we are getting in this incoming object in the form of Jason.

61
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,370
And then we're creating the student and we are returning back.

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,600
So we have an error in the import, let's review that as well.

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,150
We don't need to change anything in our getting the student body.

64
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,110
Our controller is also good.

65
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,860
Let's go there if we have an issue.

66
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,020
No, it's fine.

67
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,110
So this is our student microcircuits.

68
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,410
Now we are ready with the student service, so we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

69
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,970
Thank you very much.
