Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,270
Now you know what is office, right?

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,070
And we can handle hundreds of our thousands of Microsoft offices.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,430
Now, if we manage this micro services manually, then it will be a big task.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,710
So don't worry.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,340
Here comes the spring cloud to rescue the developers.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,110
So basically, spring cloud is having the projects that will help the developers to quickly develop

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,390
and maintain the micro services.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,350
If you want to check out all the projects provided by the spring cloud, then here is the official Web

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,780
site.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,510
Go ahead and check it out in the next lecture.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,900
We will see the spring cloud projects that we are going to cover in this course.

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,790
So we'll see you in the next lecture.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,050
Thank you very much.
