00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,230
In this lecture, we will see how about Microsoft, we can get the updated value for the property without

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,300
restarting it and for that we are going to use actuator.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,970
So first thing is we need to add the springboard starter actuator dependency in the palm cortex, email

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,670
address microsatellites.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,140
So make sure you are adding the actual dependency in the Palm TotEx email for the address.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,920
Microcircuits now lets them do the properties.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,340
So here we are going to use actuator to repossess the property values, and for that we need to expose,

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:46,180
reference and point and hence we don't need to restart our microscopist to get the updated values so

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,990
far that we need to set when property.

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,290
And that is management.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,080
DOT points.

13
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,880
Dot web dot exposer dot include equal to difference.

14
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,980
So using the repressor endpoint update to order, we will replace the property values.

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,470
Now let's turn to address controller.

16
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,650
And here we are reading the property, right.

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,430
That is addressed, the test using the value annotation.

18
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:26,180
Now, whatever place you are using that value, in addition to read the property on that glass you need

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,240
to use the notation is at a different school.

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,750
So here at a different school.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,030
So this annotation you need to mark.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,110
So here we are reading that this property inside our address controls.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,530
So we need to annotate with ATRISCO.

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,390
And if you look at this annotation, then this is coming from the sprinklered config.

25
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,260
OK, so this is the notation you need to mark.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,030
The first thing you need to do is add to the dependency and expose the rephrasing point and mark the

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,430
controller with a different scope, annotation or whatever place you are reading the property using

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,780
at value annotation.

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,040
So that's all we need to do.

30
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,820
Now our config server and unica server.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,290
OK, so let's start the address service.

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,910
Now for this profile, this address, the testing will do testing value.

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,570
OK, so let's wait for the address to get started and once that get started, will change this value.

34
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,640
So let's see in the logs.

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,410
Yes, order service got started.

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,650
Now, let's take the test.

37
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,470
Yes, we are getting the testing value now let's change it to change the value.

38
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,740
OK, now we will get testing, that's fine.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,890
OK, this is what we want to resolve using the actuator.

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,040
So what we need to do in our address, micro surveys, OK, this is the model of a micro service, a

41
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,860
product less actuator.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,830
It's less rigorous and this will be a deadbeat matter.

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,040
You don't need to pass anything else, just click on the same.

44
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,040
See, it is saying that this property value has been changed to address the noticed.

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:24,380
OK, now let's hit this gate to get the property value that is addressed to test and see if our address

46
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,290
Microsoft is now getting the updated value or not.

47
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,420
Just click on this and see now we are getting the change of the value.

48
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,370
We haven't restarted our address microsatellites.

49
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,020
Still, we got the updated value for this particular property.

50
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:38,870
Why?

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Because we have used an actuator and we have used the attorney for desktop annotation that is provided

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,300
by sprinklered config.

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,210
So two things you need to do whenever you have a change in the property, first thing is hit this post

54
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,990
you order that is less refresh on the equator and that will show you what are the properties for those.

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,080
The value has been changed and then you can get updated value, whatever places you are using.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,030
So let's remind what things we have done in this lecture at The Dependancy explores the difference and

57
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,020
point and whatever places you are hitting the property using to add value.

58
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,260
In addition, use the reference copy annotation or that class.

59
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,280
Now, after that, whenever you have a change in the property value, the first thing you need to do

60
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,980
is hit the actuator, refresh and point as a matter.

61
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,550
That's all you need to do.

62
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,780
After that, your micro service will get updated value for whatever properties you have changed up here.

63
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,610
We just changed one property value.

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,210
But if you change the multiple property values, that will be also get considered and your MIKOLA service

65
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,120
will get the updated value for all the properties.

66
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,310
Here, just for example, we took one property value, but this is applicable to multiple properties

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,670
as well.

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,170
You can change values for your multiple properties in one shot and then it does represent point that's

69
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,980
completely fine.

70
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,080
Actuator will work and you will get the updated property values for Microsoft's.

71
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,320
So this is how our micro surveys can get the updated value of property without restarting it using actuator,

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,490
so that's all for now.

73
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,200
We'll see you in the next lecture.

74
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,670
Thank you very much.
