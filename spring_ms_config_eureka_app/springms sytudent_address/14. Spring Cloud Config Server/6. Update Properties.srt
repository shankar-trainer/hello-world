00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello and welcome back here.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,470
Our address microcircuits is reading the properties using config Sarovar and the profile we said is

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,850
the.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,540
And these are the properties it is reading using the config Sarwan.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,770
Now, say, for example, for a property, we are changing its value.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,910
For example, this property right address noticed we are changing its value from testing to see, for

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,550
example, change the value.

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,440
This is just one example.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,610
OK, so we have a change in the property value for the property.

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,070
Now, let's see if we can fix that.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,380
What is getting the updated value or not?

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,270
So let's jump to Posman and let's see the conflicts are over for our address.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:56,440
Micro service properties do click on the same you to the profile to scroll down see address noticed.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,990
It is changing the value.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,100
That means our conflicts are what is reading the updated value.

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,040
So we are good with our config server because it is getting the updated value.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,140
Now how about our address microcircuits?

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,170
So let's take it out that as well.

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,240
So this is the last test.

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,770
This is what reading the property right.

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,790
Address noticed.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,480
So click on this n c still it is getting the old value that is testing here.

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,290
We have changed its value from testing to change the value of a conflict.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,840
So nobody's getting the updated value.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,590
But still our micro Sarbaz is reading the old value.

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,890
It's not getting the updated value.

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,790
Why?

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,890
The reason is that when you start to microsatellites right, it will read the properties on start up

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,230
using the config server.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,570
So after your MicroStrategy starts and you have a change in the property, even your config server is

31
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,860
getting the updated value.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,430
Your MICRA service will not get the updated value because it has read the properties on the start up

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:07,270
using the config server and after that you made a change for the property so it will not get updated

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,770
value for your property.

35
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,960
And this is what happening over here.

36
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,160
So if you want that, your address, Microsoft read the latest value, whatever, we change it for the

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,000
property, then what do you need to do?

38
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,110
You need to restart your address.

39
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,910
Microsoft Office.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,900
So let me stop the address.

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,270
Microsoft Office, wait for a few seconds.

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,120
Just ignore the Zipkin and Gateway errors or hear because I'm directly running the address.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,790
Microsoft Office.

44
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,140
Yes.

45
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,570
Now, Wittstock, let me start again.

46
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,640
Pressed Microsoft Office.

47
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,220
So here we are just running the server configure and address Microsoft Office.

48
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,820
Now, let's try this again and see if it is reading the updated value or not.

49
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,820
See, now it's giving us the change of value, so what we need to do, we need to restart our micro

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,460
service if we have a change in property value.

51
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,960
But this is not a good thing, right?

52
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,530
We have just one property value changed and we need to restart our micro services, even our conflicts.

53
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,070
Server is reading the updated value.

54
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,850
Still, we need to restart our Microsoft Office.

55
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,600
So what to do in this case?

56
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,090
That's what we are going to see in the next lecture, that how to read the updated value in your micro

57
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,430
servers without restarting your Microsoft office so that we will see in the next lecture.

58
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,470
So that's all for now.

59
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,240
We'll see you in the next lecture.

60
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,770
Thank you very much.
