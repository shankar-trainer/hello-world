00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,030
In this lecture, we will store the micro service properties energy triple.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,860
Now it can be GitHub Gottleib or it can be a local repository as well.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,340
So for simplicity, we will go with the local guide.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,470
So first thing is you need to download and install it in your local machine.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,140
So just search the Google that did download.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,290
This is the official website, Objet.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,810
And according to your operating system, download it and install in your local machine.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,320
Now, after that, go to the directory, whatever it is, OK, in your local mazing, create the new

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:40,820
folder.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,440
So I'm giving the name is Local Rebel.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,670
Whatever you want to.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,710
You give it a name.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,250
Open that folder.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,900
Now, inside this folder, we need to give the properties file for what micro services now lets them

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,580
do this.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,740
So for example, we want to store address service properties in the.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,990
So let me open the application properties file.

19
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:11,390
So these properties we want to store in the local market and we want to use the conflicts that in our

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,050
address Microsoft Office, you can do all these things for your other micro services as well here.

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,580
Just for an example, I am taking the address service, but this is applicable to all the micro services.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,550
So let's copy these properties file.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:34,330
And put over here now we need to give this properties file name as our microcircuits name.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,180
So in our example address service is the application name or against the service name.

25
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,260
So let's rename this.

26
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,780
That's all we need to do here.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,080
We are not specifying any environment or you can say profile.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,070
Right.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,980
So it will be a default profile.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,550
So first we are going with the default profile and then we will see different profiles like Dale Kuai

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,140
abroad so that we will see in the upcoming Lichter's.

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,930
For now we are going with the default profile.

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,260
Now we have this application that properties file over here, let me open it, and we need to remove

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,740
this one.

35
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,960
We don't require service anymore here.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,110
That's all.

37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,890
Let me close it now for a disservice.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,860
We don't need these properties, OK?

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,630
So apart from application and name, let's remove all the properties.

40
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,330
That's it.

41
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,430
We don't require any other property, just our service name.

42
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,520
We want to have inside this and this file also will remain, but that we will see in the upcoming lectures.

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,820
For now, we just have removed the properties.

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,050
We just required application anymore here.

45
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,470
Now, this file we added over here.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:41,820
Right.

47
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,170
But still, it's not committed to a local.

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,390
So just open the gate over here.

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
Now, hit the commanders.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,560
Get in it.

51
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,590
Now, let's add the file that we added, Surjeet, and then space dot.

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,500
Now let's commit this one Sloggett comit then our message.

53
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,580
The first commit.

54
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,010
Let's check the status.

55
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,990
Yes, we are on the masterbrand and we have already committed this one fight.

56
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,590
That is a service, not properties.

57
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,790
Now, just copy this, but let's verify.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,700
Go to the browser and go.

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,290
See, this is our local guide.

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,090
Triple open these properties.

61
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,500
These are the properties we have inside this particular pile.

62
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,450
And this is our guide.

63
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,940
And this is what we are going to use for our config server and from config server.

64
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,210
Our address MICRA service will read these properties.

65
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,730
So as of now, the profile is default.

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,620
So this is all we need to do for our local people and restore trust, restored property is vital in

67
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,950
our local people.

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,580
Now in the next lecture will create the conflicts are over.

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,710
So that's all for now.

70
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,380
Will proceed further in the next lecture.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,730
Thank you very much.
