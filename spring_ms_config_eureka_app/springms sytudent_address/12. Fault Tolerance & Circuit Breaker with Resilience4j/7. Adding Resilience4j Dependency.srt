00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,220
Hello and welcome back for the upcoming lectures.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,930
We are going to implement circuit breaker using Resilience 4G.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,460
So let's start by adding the dependencies in the bombed out XML for a student service.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,180
So the very first dependency we need to add is resilience for this spring.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,020
Bhuto and this is the latest version when I'm recording this lecture.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,000
Whatever is latest version, when you are watching this, you can go for it now.

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,630
Internally, Resilience for days using Spring LP.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,540
So we need to add your dependency as well and that is a springboard starter LP.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,940
Now to take the current state of the suite, we are going to use the actuator.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,210
So this is the dependency we need to add for actuator.

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,150
That is a springboard starter actuator.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,660
So make sure you are adding these three dependencies in the bombed out XML for your student service.

13
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,240
Now, let's make a slight change in our student service, so you remember this matter.

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,060
Earlier, we used to make the call to address service, but that was using that Web client.

15
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,420
But now we are using the front line.

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,430
So let's remove this word here.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,780
And this piece of code to make the call to address service will put over here like this.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,150
Address response.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,630
And.

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,710
Return the address response.

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,290
And we will call this matter from here.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,380
Same thing we will do over here.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:58,400
So now we have this method to make the call to address service, and here we need to address it.

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,490
Now we are good.

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,650
So on this matter, we will apply the circuit breaker, because inside this matter only we are making

26
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,650
the call to address service.

27
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,360
So we are going to implement the circuit breaker on this particular matter.

28
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,770
So that we will see in the upcoming lectures.

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,590
So that's all for now will proceed further in the next lecture.

30
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,880
Thank you very much.
