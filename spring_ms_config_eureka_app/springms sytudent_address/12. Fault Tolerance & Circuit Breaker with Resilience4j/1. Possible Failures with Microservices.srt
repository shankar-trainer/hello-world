Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,190
For the upcoming lectures.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:13,050
We will be focusing on the tolerance and circuit breaker for our micro services and for that we are

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,670
going to use resilience for the micro services.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,400
But before that, you need to understand a few concepts.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,010
Now, let's first see the problem scenario.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:31,730
Let's see what are the failures that can be possible with our micro services, so in our example, we

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,090
know that student service is calling the address service.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,150
Now, it may be possible that a drug service itself is down.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,810
The second thing is that a drug service is having high failure rate.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,580
There can be any reasons for a drug service to have high failure rate.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:57,060
It may be possible that a drug service has some issue while connecting to a database or any other reason.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,910
And because of that, it's a high failure rate.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,600
Now, this kind of illness can be possible to any of your micro services.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,950
So now the question is how to deal with this kind of.

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,880
So that's what we are going to cover in the upcoming elections and we are going to use resilience for

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,810
hour micro services to handle this kind of failures.

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,030
So that's all for now will proceed further in the next lecture.

19
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,470
Thank you very much.
