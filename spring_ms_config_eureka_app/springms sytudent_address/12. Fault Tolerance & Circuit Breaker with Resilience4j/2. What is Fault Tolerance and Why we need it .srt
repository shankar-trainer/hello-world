00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,760
In this lecture, we will see what is for tolerance and why we need it.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,900
So in our example, student service is calling the address service and say, for example, address service

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,190
is having some issue.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,550
And because of that, it's observing more failures.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,050
Now, because of this, what will happen, our student service will also observe more failures.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,710
Now, say, for example, result service is calling the student service.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,770
So the same will apply to result service as well.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,560
It will also observe more failures.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,810
And same for examination service as well, because examination service is calling the result service.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,890
So here we just have issue or fault in our address service, but it is getting prosecuted to our other

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,050
Migros services.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,480
Now, here we just have four micro services.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,390
But when you are working in the real time application, right, you might be having hundreds of or thousands

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,760
of micro services.

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,420
Now, just imagine that you are one micro service is having some issue.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,080
And because of that, either 100 or 200 micro service is getting impacted.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,890
So that should not happen.

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,230
Right.

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,190
So here comes the fault tolerance.

21
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,320
So here we know that our address, micro surveys is having some issues.

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,370
Now we will try that the issues should not get cascaded to other micro services.

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,920
So we will try that our other micro services will have minimal impact.

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,510
So this is for tolerance and why we need it, so that's all for now, will proceed further in the next

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,140
lecture.

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,730
Thank you very much.
