00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,150
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,990
In the previous lecture, we noted this matter using the annotation as a circuit breaker and we provided

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,280
the instance Naem.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,270
Now here we are making the RESCALE to address service now.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,310
For example, our address service is getting some error or Sipson, be it for four or five hundred internal

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,040
server error.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,970
OK, so we are not getting the proper response from address service.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,230
So in that case, we need to provide the fallback method and instead the fallback method will return

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,700
the dummy response.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,630
So here we need to provide another attribute that is Folbigg matter and we need to provide the name

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,730
of Folbigg method.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,260
So let's provide like this.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,170
Folbigg and get addressed by Idy You can give any name, you can just give meaningfully.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,280
So we need to create this method that is basically our fallback method.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:06,120
Now, by creating the Folbigg method, you need to remember one thing that it must have the same method

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,940
signature as your method on which you have a circuit breaker a.D.A.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,790
So in our case, this is the method get addressed by Idy.

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,480
Let me copy all the things from here and put me over here.

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,530
This is the method name.

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,620
Now we are good and here we need to return the dummy response, so, for example, we are returning

21
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,830
new object of interest response.

22
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,110
You can return anything.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,890
OK, this is Dommy response.

24
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,250
Why?

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,200
Because we are not getting the proper response from the service.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,140
So it will go to our fallback method and will return the dummy response, whatever we want to return.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,440
Another example, we are just returning the new object of interest response and it must have the same

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,860
method signature as your method on which you have a circuit breaker annotation.

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,500
Now, one more parameter you can set in the method and that is optional and that is provable.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,520
Like this, so this will give you the exception if you want to log so that we will see in the upcoming

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,890
lectures.

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,630
OK, but this is a personal one.

33
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:21,430
This is much because it shouldn't matter what method signature for this matter on which we have a circuit

34
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,480
breaker annotation.

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,940
And here we provided the fallback method.

36
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,220
And this is our fallback method.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,740
Now say the speed is closer.

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,130
So here it will try to call the address service using the faint light and say, for example, it is

39
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,470
returning, though, find it internal server error.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,390
So it will come forward for dark matter and it will return the dummy response.

41
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,010
It will not fail, though, student service.

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,300
Instead of that, it will return the dummy response from the fallback method.

43
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,610
Whatever we provided no set.

44
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,080
For example, switch is open, so no calls are allowed from student to address service.

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,440
So this matter will not get executed because we are not allowed to make the calls to address service.

46
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:09,650
So this piece of code, basically whatever we have in this matter will not get executed.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,560
Instead of that, it will directly come to our fallback method and will return the dummy response.

48
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,940
The same applies.

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,620
What happens data is, well, we are allowing five calls in the open state.

50
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,610
And so, for example, Edra Service is giving some exception.

51
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,730
So it will come to our fallback and will return the dummy response.

52
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,050
So the bottom line is, whatever the state the suite is having, it will always come to our fallback

53
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,500
method.

54
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,390
If a service is giving some error, exception doesn't matter.

55
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,390
Whatever state you have for your switch.

56
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,310
If a service is having some issue, it will come to your fallback method and it will return the dummy

57
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,940
response.

58
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,430
So that's the use of fallback method.

59
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,400
The fallback method must need to have the same method signature as like your method on which you have

60
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,260
a circuit breaker and descent and you can use this optional one trouble to lock the exception.

61
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,050
So this is the use of Fulbeck method.

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,710
So that's all for now will proceed further in the next lecture.

63
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,390
Thank you very much.
