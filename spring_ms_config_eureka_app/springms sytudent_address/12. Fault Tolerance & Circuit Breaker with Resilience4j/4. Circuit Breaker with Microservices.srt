Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:11,180
In the previous lecture, we have seen what is a circuit breaker now in this lecture we will see circuit

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,860
breaker in context of micro services.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,290
So in our example, we know that student service is calling the address service.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,930
Now, see here we have one switch.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,740
Obviously, this is not the electrical switch if this suite is closed.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,550
That means all the calls from student service to address service are allowed.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,450
If this switch is open, then all the calls from student service to address service are not allowed.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,000
So if there is no issue in the service, the switch will be closer, if that is an issue in the service,

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,130
we will make this switch as open.

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,960
And obviously this is not the electrical switch, so we need to design it.

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,230
And for that, we need to define some properties.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,690
And accordingly, this switch will be here.

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,300
So basically, we need to configure the switch.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,900
So for this, we have a circuit breaker design pattern and we are going to use a resilience for the

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,800
circuit breaker.

17
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:17,590
So in the upcoming lectures, we will see how to design and configure the suite and accordingly this

18
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,390
which will be help whenever there is an issue in the service, it will automatically identify and it

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,540
will make this which is open so that all the calls from the student services to address service are

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,230
not allowed.

21
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,190
And by that, we can say over other micro services.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,310
So in the upcoming lectures, we will see resilience circuit breaker.

23
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,460
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

24
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,960
Thank you very much.
