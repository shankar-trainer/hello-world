00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,070
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,170
In the previous lecture, we have seen how to use the paint lined along with the EPA gateway to call

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,690
the service from our student service.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,960
Now, if you remember that in one of the previous lecture, we have created this load balancer while

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,110
calling the address service from our student service.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,430
But now in England, we are using the EPA gateway.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,590
We are not directly calling the address service and we know that EPA gateway is doing the load balancing

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,090
for us.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,190
So now we don't need this load balancer.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,000
So let's comment it out and let's test the load.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,590
Balancing is working or not.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,080
So let's start with the Utica server.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,630
Then the EPA gateway.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,530
Will start the student service and the first instance of a service on board, a donate to the second,

15
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,600
we will start on board a derogatory.

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:05,370
So this is a druidry led to the second instance of a dress service, give this some time because I get

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,860
when your server is working, we can take over here.

18
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,360
We have a good restaurant service, let's wait for the address service.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
We have one instance of better service.

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,400
Let's wait for another one.

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,760
Yeah, now we are all set a disservice to instances.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,080
We have epic adventure in service.

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,350
Now, let's clear the logs for our address service here.

24
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,840
This is first instance.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,280
This is second.

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,310
Let's clear the logs.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,460
Now let's turn to Posman.

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,980
And hit this giddap.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,610
This is fantastic.

30
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,970
This will hit three more.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,710
This is second, third and now fourth.

32
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,630
We are all set.

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,680
Let's take the logs.

34
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,360
Let's move to address service.

35
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,210
This is the first instance seek to request here now in the second instance.

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,800
Toward here, so it'd be a good way of doing the load, balancing across the two instances of our adversaries,

37
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,100
and the reason is that now we are using the EPA get wind of being light and using this line.

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,310
We are calling the service from our student service.

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,180
So we don't need to worry about the load balancing.

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,940
Basically, we don't need to have our own implementation for clean side load balancing if we are using

41
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,840
EPA to be.

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,910
So now you got the idea that we will do the load balancing for us and we don't need to worry about it,

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,810
so that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

44
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,280
Thank you very much.
