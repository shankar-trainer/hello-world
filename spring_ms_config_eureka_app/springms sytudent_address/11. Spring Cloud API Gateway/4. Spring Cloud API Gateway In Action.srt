00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,710
So now we are all set with our spring cloud getaway.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,110
So let's start with the Eureka server and then we will start the gateway.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,330
And after that, we will start our micro services to run my groceries and now address Microsoft Office.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,280
Lets them do Eureka.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,990
Let's reload this.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,260
EPA gateway has registred.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,530
Wait for the migrant services.

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,620
Yes, now we are good, our micro services, along with the EPA, we have registered themselves with

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,320
the Utica now lets them do the postman.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,520
So now we have used this, you are allowed to hate our student service because of a student service

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,350
is running on the board a zero eight zero, and now we are not going to use this.

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,370
You instead of this, we will use the you are not Ed Gateway.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,930
And we know that Be Gateway is running on the point nine zero nine zero.

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,930
And then we need to provide the name of service.

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,630
So in our case, student service.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,080
Now, let's get idea.

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:27,780
See, we got the response, so this you are we hit up Gateway, but actually we are down student service,

19
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,350
but we are not using the you are a student service.

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:37,650
Earlier we were using the you are a student service, but now we are using the you are an up gateway

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,720
to hit our student service.

22
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,940
Now, it may be possible that when you hit this giddap right, or any other Epper, you will get four

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,400
zero four.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,910
That's obvious.

25
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,740
Don't worry.

26
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,780
Give the EPA, get the application a minute and then try again.

27
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,650
Because what happens when you start to appreciate the application, right.

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,120
It will affect all the services from the Eureka server.

29
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,970
So this will take some time.

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,990
Sometimes it may be 30 seconds to one minute.

31
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,860
So don't worry.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,100
Wait for a minute and then try again.

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,800
So now this is the you are all for our student service and this you are all you need to provide to your

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,110
consumers, not this one.

35
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,040
That is the actual you are all of your student service localhost.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,510
Ejiro, Ed, you should not give this you out to your consumers.

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,530
Instead of that, you need to give that you all of your EP Gateway and slash your microscopist name.

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,940
So now here, Ippei Gateways routing this particular gate request to our student service and hence we

39
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,700
are getting the response and this is expected.

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,990
We have already seen.

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,630
So this is how you can use sprinklered, cloud, API, gateway for your micro services along with your

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,360
Akazawa.

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,120
So that's all for now, will proceed further in the next lecture.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
Thank you very much.
