Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,590
So now we know that our API Gateway application will work with Unica Server to allow the request to

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,940
appropriate Microsoft Office, but for that, we need to configure it.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,700
So let's enable the discovery locator for our API Gateway application.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,650
So we need to set properties.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,650
Spring cloud.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,530
Gateway.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,560
That discovery locator enabled a call to prove.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, let's go to the Eureka server here, you see the application name in the press, but if we actually

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,150
look in the application, the properties of our micro service, then we have provided in the lowercase.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,840
But Yanagisawa is residing in the upper case.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:55,060
So we need to tell this to our API Gateway application that look for the micro services in lowercase.

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,810
So for that, we need to define the property in our gateway application as.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,150
Out cloud.

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:12,340
Gateway thought this Cody locator and then lower case service I'd call to through.

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,290
So now even the Utica server is providing the service name in the upper case to over a period of application,

17
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,250
it will look for the Lorqess service name or you can say service ID.

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,570
You can read this documentation as well, what it is saying.

19
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:40,970
Option to Lorqess, the service that pretty useful with Unica when it automatically abacuses service

20
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,590
idee or you can say application mean or you cancel service name.

21
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,550
So my service would magids less my service from uppercase to Lorqess.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,500
I don't know, for some reason, this is giving Iran even we provided a boolean value, so we will ignore

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,860
this.

24
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:04,160
So this is the configuration we need to do and now we are ready with our Epper Gateway application.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,990
So in the next lecture, we will test it out.

26
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,930
So that's all for now.

27
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,720
Will proceed further in the next lecture.

28
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,280
Thank you very much.
