00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,180
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:09,200
In this lecture, we will configure our faint line to achieve the client side load balancing in the

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:16,100
student service support that we need to add this dependency in the bombed out example of student service.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,450
And the dependency is spinning loud starter load balancer.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,970
So make sure you are adding this dependency in the bombed out example of your student service.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,840
Now to make the rest call from student service to address service, we have the faint line and that

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,300
is address faint line.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,250
We have already seen this right and using the Eureka server, we are providing the service name or here.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,530
So now let's configure this vent line to use the spring cloud load balancer.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,000
So here, let's create a new class for the configuration.

11
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,830
Let me give the name as address service.

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,430
Load balancer config I'm giving in the short form.

13
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,450
Click on the Finniss.

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,330
Now we need to annotate this class with the load balancer client.

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,740
Now, in England, we have provided this value, right?

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,470
That is the name of the service.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,320
So same thing we need to provide with this annotation as well so that it will identify that this is

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,240
the load balancer for this particular faint client.

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,050
So make sure you are giving the same value as you have in your phone line.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,730
So in our case, this is the name of the service because we are using the Eureka server.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,230
So now what happens when we will start the student service?

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,720
It will create the Benoff front line, so at the time we need to configure the load balancing.

23
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,790
So what we will do here is that let's create the being of Fien.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,370
Dart builder, see?

25
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,110
Famed builder.

26
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,360
Let's return.

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,740
Fiend, art builder, this matter.

28
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:15,720
So this is the being we are creating in our student service will start now here we need to tell that

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,360
we want to have load balancing.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,310
So mark this with at Lower Peninsula.

31
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,500
So what will happen when we will start our student service?

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,010
It will configure this vein builder.

33
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,900
At the time we are seeing that this is load balancer and for which ringland?

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,440
That is what we provided here with the value.

35
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,660
This is for the service and for that we have this address front line.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,940
So what will happen?

37
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,550
Whenever you will use the instance of this address being lined, it will get load balancer.

38
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,650
It doesn't matter where you are using here we are using in the student service so that also it will

39
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,990
get automatically load balancer.

40
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,110
If you are using in any of the other packages or other classes you are using the instance of this particular

41
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,700
line, it will automatically get lower peninsula here if you open.

42
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:10,940
Here, we don't need to change anything, we don't need to change anything, just our class where we

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,280
are configuring and providing the name of the service.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,640
In our case, we have a service and we are saying that this is load bearing the faint line.

45
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,530
That's it.

46
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,510
This is all you need to do to configure the sprinklered load balancing in your student service.

47
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,180
Now we are all set with our client and spring cloud load balancer.

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,110
We will test it out in the next lecture.

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,130
So that's all for now.

50
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,860
Will proceed further in the next lecture.

51
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,480
Thank you very much.
