00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,970
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:10,680
In this lecture, we will create our very first open line to make the call to address service from our

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,680
student service.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,840
So let's go for it inside this package, create the new interface.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,160
As I said, our client will be an interface.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,460
So let's give it a name as address fiend client.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,210
Now we need to know that it with Ed Feen client.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,750
And here we need to provide a couple of things.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,900
The first is you are.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,590
So this will be the you are telaprevir service that we want to call.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:48,210
So in our case, that you are a lot at risk service so that we have already inside the application,

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,900
not property.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,710
So let's read this property out here.

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,260
So this is the address you are in now.

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,250
The second thing is we need to give this client a name.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,960
OK, say address, phone client.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,910
You can give any name.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,570
It's up to you.

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,320
Let me maximize this so that we have a better idea.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,290
So this is our Fenland.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,320
This is the you are to make the call, whatever it is, gatepost or put right.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,530
This is the service you are in and this is the value we are giving the name to this client.

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,190
So this is one v. There is another way using the part attribute.

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,020
So what we can do instead of providing this, you are all here.

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,330
Let's remove this and just how the you are allowed this address service and here in our client give

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,480
the part.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,080
Equal to this one, this is over, you are.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,140
So this will be over.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,300
You are not lot better service or whatever we want to call out and it will append this spot after that.

30
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,180
So if you don't want to hardcourt all the things we're hearing, the application, not properties,

31
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,720
you can put like this as often or you can directly provide the complete, you are allowed here as hardcoded

32
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,040
whatever you want to do.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,950
Here we are reading from the application that properties just that you are an operator service and this

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,090
we are putting in the pot.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,320
Now, let's move ahead and let's open the address controller.

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,380
So now from the civil service, we want to call this get by IDP's, right, getting the address by Heidi.

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,860
So let's copy this.

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,590
Completing from the air traffic controller and in our front line, put it like this.

39
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:38,290
Now, this implementation we don't need because here we want to call that grapey, we don't need its

40
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,220
implementation date, so let's remove it implementation complete thing.

41
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,190
We just want metter signature like this.

42
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,750
That's it.

43
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,630
Now, we just need to get the instance of this address being blind.

44
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,040
We just need to call this matter and it will call this gatepost the address service, because here we

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,930
have provided that you are a lot better service and we provided the party as well.

46
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,870
That is, you are right.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
And this is also we have done get mapping it all and this will poza part variable.

48
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,540
So all things are done.

49
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,010
Now let's compare this with the address controller.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
So here you see on the top we have this mappings Lesseps.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,260
Let's address yes we have over here.

52
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,570
And the same thing.

53
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,970
We have this one to get mapping.

54
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,270
The difference is we don't have implementation over here.

55
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,200
And that's obvious.

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,530
Why?

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,580
Because every service will be having the implementation here.

58
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,570
We are calling the address service so we don't need implementation.

59
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,690
Does the matter signature.

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,440
Now, let's have instances of this address, Vinland, in the student service.

61
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,740
So let's autogiro here

62
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,610
like this.

63
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,050
Now, using this instance of a dress, being blind will make the gate call to address service.

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,970
So here, let me comment this out for your reference.

65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,140
And instead of calling this get addressed by Idy, which is using the Web client, we are going to use

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,000
the open field.

67
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:21,830
So here we will use the address phone line to get my ID and pass the address I.D. That's it.

68
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,140
We don't need to do anything else out here.

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,950
Let's do the same thing in the getting the student by idea as well.

70
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,550
So here we are using the open phone line to make the race call to address service instead incident we

71
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,790
planned earlier, we use a.

72
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,330
Now we are using Fenland to make the race calls from our spring wood application.

73
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,210
So we are all set with our very first lined in the student service to make the right call to address

74
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,470
service now in the next lecture.

75
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,140
We will test it out our very first faint line.

76
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,050
So that's all for now.

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,840
Will proceed further in the next lecture.

78
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,340
Thank you very much.
