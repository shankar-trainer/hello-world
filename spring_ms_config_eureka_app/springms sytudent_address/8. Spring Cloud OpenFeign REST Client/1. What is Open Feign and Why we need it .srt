00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,770
Hello and welcome back for the upcoming lectures, Will this spring cloud open open-faced?

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,330
Now, before we jump to that, let's first understand what is spring cloud open-faced and why we need

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,850
to use innervate spring board application.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,230
So here Open-Faced is restraint to make the right calls.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,850
But what spring would application?

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,210
So using the open-faced, we can make wrist calls to other services, but almost spring board application.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,510
Other services can be our micro services or any other third party service.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,400
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,600
So in the previous lectures, we have seen how to use vaped line to make the calls, but a springboard

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,320
application.

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,260
So you may be thinking that why we need to go with open vein when we can do the same thing with Verplank.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,100
So that advantage of using the open is that it's providing a declaratively and it is making our life

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,000
very easy to make the race calls from what springboard application.

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,330
Now, let me explain you the declarative method that we have in Open-Faced.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,610
Now let's go to one controller.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,550
So this is our controller in any of this being good applications, right.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,230
We have Riklis mapping on the controller level and then we have different mappings.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,810
Get mapping, Boice mapping, input, mapping.

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,070
Right.

20
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,910
Whatever we have.

21
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,660
And here we are providing the path variable or if you have any query bottoms then we use at request.

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,430
But I'm an addition.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,190
And if you have any request payload that is coming into the request in the format of Jizan, then we

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,250
use at request buddhi annotation.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,310
So this is declaratively we are providing that TDP matter.

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,310
We are providing that you are a part variable all with the annotations and we are using in the method.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,590
So open pain provides the same kind of declarative metal to make the response, yes, you heard it right.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,350
This is the steps that the consumers are calling, right.

29
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,200
Whatever incoming requests basically to this particular springboard application.

30
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,050
Now, we can have the same kind of declarative declaratively that we have in our controller to make

31
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,090
the race calls to other services.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,380
It can be our own micro services or any other third party service.

33
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,620
We will use the same kind of annotation because then also we are making the get call or call.

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,730
We are also passing the part variable request from credit parameters.

35
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,810
You can see on.

36
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,890
We are also passing the request in or in the format up decent.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,950
We have already seen or hear right using the reply and we are passing this.

38
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,540
You are right.

39
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,110
And this part variable and this we can do with this kind of mapping is it.

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,570
And that's what Open-Faced provides.

41
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,750
And this is the advantage of Sprint out of one thing.

42
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,910
And that's what we are going to implement in the upcoming lectures in the student service.

43
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,430
To make you understand that, why, Open-Faced, we need to use we have already implemented this wetland

44
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,610
so that you will get the idea that how open open-faced makes our life very easy and you can easily compare

45
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,240
vaped lined with open fields.

46
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,530
So this is an overview of open field.

47
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,260
And in the upcoming lectures, we will use the open field in our student service to make the rest calls

48
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,550
to address service.

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,770
So that's all for now.

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,650
Will proceed further in the next lecture.

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,940
Thank you very much.
