00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,370
Hello and welcome back for the upcoming lectures.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,660
We will see how to use sprinklered open FEEN in the student service to make the rest calls to address

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,130
service.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,010
So let's start by adding the sprinklered open-faced dependancy in the bombed out Zemel of student service.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,100
Now, here we are going to use the spring cloud Vasan as three zero one.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,320
This is the letters were done when I'm recording this lecture.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,410
Whatever letters Vasan is available for you when you are watching this lecture, you can go for it in

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:34,920
this schools.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,440
Whatever dependencies we are going to add for the spring cloud, this will be the version here.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,100
I read it this vasan in the properties so that we don't need to repeat vasan in each and every dependancy.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,190
And whenever we want to update Deverson, we can easily update by just putting the letters were sent

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,720
over here.

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,380
Now let's come down.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,170
And this is the dependancy for sprinklered.

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,920
Open Feen.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,010
This is sprinklered starter open-faced.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,110
And this is the first entry zero one.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,290
This is coming from the property that we added or here.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:16,270
This one now, after the dependancy, let's create a separate package for the faint line, so let's

20
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,390
say the packages come in, people start faint lines.

21
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,260
Now, using this package, we need to enable the faint lines.

22
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,480
So let's go to our main class and we will use the annotation as enable.

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,920
Faint lines and provide the package, that's it, so by using this holiday season, we are seeing that

24
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,520
we are going to use the front lines in this spring season.

25
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,030
And this is the package that we have over faint lines.

26
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,180
So Fenland is basically an interface and that's what we are going to create in the next lecture.

27
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,700
This is the configuration part that we have done, adding the dependancy, creating the package and

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,060
enabling the front lines in our spring board application.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,330
So that's all for now will proceed further in the next lecture.

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,860
Thank you very much.
