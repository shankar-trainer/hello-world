Hibernate Template

When Spring and Hibernate integration started, Spring ORM provided two helper classes – HibernateDaoSupport and HibernateTemplate. The reason to use them was to get the Session from Hibernate and get the benefit of Spring transaction management. However from Hibernate 3.0.1, we can use SessionFactory getCurrentSession() method to get the current session and use it to get the spring transaction management benefits. If you go through above examples, you will see how easy it is and that’s why we should not use these classes anymore.

One other benefit of HibernateTemplate was exception translation but that can be achieved easily by using @Repository annotation with service classes, shown in above spring mvc example. This is a trick question to judge your knowledge and whether you are aware of recent developments or not.

Add ½ to 1 tsp (3-6 g) of baking soda into 8 oz (237 mL) of water.
Baking soda is a natural cooking ingredient that’s also highly alkaline. With its pH of 9, it easily raises your water’s pH. Simply pour ½ to 1 tsp (3-6 g) of baking soda into an 8 oz (237 mL) glass of water and stir or shake the glass well to fully combine the baking soda and water.[2]
Drink no more than 1 glass of baking soda each day. Ingesting large quantities of baking soda can be toxic and cause vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle weakness.[3]
Do not drink water alkalized with baking soda if you are on a low-sodium diet for health reasons. Baking soda is high in sodium.
